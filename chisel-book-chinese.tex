\chapter{Preface}

% This text goes on the backside of the book, and in Amazon description
This book is an introduction to digital design with the focus on using the hardware construction language Chisel. Chisel brings advances from software engineering, such as object-orientated and functional languages, into digital design.

This book addresses hardware designers and software engineers. Hardware designers, with knowledge of Verilog or VHDL, can upgrade their productivity with a modern language for their next ASIC or FPGA design. Software engineers, with knowledge of object-oriented and functional programming, can leverage their knowledge to program hardware, for example, FPGA accelerators executing in the cloud.

The approach of this book is to present small to medium-sized typical hardware components to explore digital design with Chisel.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

I want to thank everyone who has worked on Chisel for creating such
a cool hardware construction language. Chisel is so joyful to use and
therefore worth writing a book about.
I am thankful to the whole Chisel community, which is so welcoming and friendly
and never tired to answer questions on Chisel.

I would also like to thank my students in the last years of an advanced computer
architecture course where most of them picked up Chisel for the final project.
Thank you for moving out of your comfort zone and taking up the journey of
learning and using a bleeding-edge hardware description language.
Many of your questions have helped to shape this book.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This book is an introduction to digital system design using a modern hardware
construction language, \myref{https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/}{Chisel}~\cite{chisel:dac2012}.
In this book, we focus on a higher abstraction level than usual in digital design books,
to enable you to build more complex, interacting digital systems in a shorter time.

这本书是一个使用现代硬件构建语言Chisel做数字系统设计的导论。
在这本书，我们聚焦在比平常的硬件设计更高抽象层，
使搭建更为复杂和交互性的硬件系统变得可能。

This book and Chisel are targeting two groups of developers:
(1) hardware designers and (2) software programmers.
Hardware designers who are fluid in VHDL or Verilog and using other languages such as Python,
Java, or Tcl to generate hardware can move to a single hardware construction language
where hardware generation is part of the language and
Software programmers may become interested in hardware design,
e.g., as future chips from Intel will include programmable hardware to speed up programs.
It is perfectly fine to use Chisel as your first hardware description language.

这本书和Chisel的目标群体是两种开发者：
（1）硬件设计者 （2）软件编程者

硬件设计者，精通VHDL或是Verilog，使用其它语言，像是Python, Java, 或是TCL/TK去生成硬件，使其变成一个硬件建造语言，这样，生成硬件作为语言的一部分。

软件编程者，对硬件设计有兴趣的软件程序员，例如，像是Intel未来的芯片会添加可编程硬件用来提高程序速度。


Chisel brings advances in software engineering, such as object-orientated
and functional languages, into digital design.
Chisel does not only allow to express hardware at the register-transfer level
but allows you to write hardware generators.

Chisel给软件工程带来了优势，像是把目标和函数编程，代入了数字设计。
Chisel不仅仅允许表示硬件在寄存器传输的抽象层，而且允许你编写硬件生成器。

Hardware is now commonly described with a hardware description language.
The time of drawing hardware components, even with CAD tools, is
over. Some high-level schematics can give an overview of the system but are
not intended to describe the system.

硬件现在普遍通过硬件描述语言进行描述。
描画硬件部分的时间，甚至是使用CAD工具画图，这个时代已经过去了。
有一些高级草图可以给你一个系统的整体描绘，但是它们不是用来描述系统的。

The two most common hardware description languages are Verilog and VHDL.
Both languages are old, contain many legacies, and have a moving line of what
constructs of the language are synthesizable to hardware.
Do not get me wrong: VHDL and Verilog are perfectly able to describe a hardware
block that can be synthesized into an
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit}{ASIC}.
For hardware design in Chisel, Verilog serves as an intermediate language
for testing and synthesis.

两个最常用的硬件描述语言是Verilog和VHDL。
这两个语言是古老的，包括大量规则，并且在综合到硬件的构建语言之间有一个变动的规则。
不要把我理解错了：VHDL和Verilog可以完美描述用来综合成ASIC的硬件部分。
对于Chisel的硬件设计，verilog充当一个测试和综合的中间语言。

This book is not a general introduction to hardware design and the fundamentals of it.
For an introduction of the basics in digital design, such as how to build a gate out of
CMOS transistors, refer to other digital design books.
However, this book intends to teach digital design at an abstraction level that is
current practice to describe ASICs or designs targeting
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array}{FPGA}s.\footnote{As the author is more familiar with FPGAs
than ASICs as target technology, some design optimizations shown in this book are
targeting FPGA technology.}
As prerequisites for this book, we assume basic knowledge of
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra}{Boolean algebra} and the
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number}{binary number system}.
Furthermore, some programming experience in any programming language
is assumed. No knowledge of Verilog or VHDL is needed.
Chisel can be your first programming language to describe digital hardware.
As the build process in the examples is based on \code{sbt} and \code{make}
basic knowledge of the command-line interface (CLI, also called terminal or
Unix shell) will be helpful.

这本书不是一个泛泛而谈的硬件设计和基础导论。
对于一个基础的导论，像是如何使用CMOS晶体管搭建一个门电路，你要参考其它数字设计书。
但是，这本书的目的是教你在一个抽象层中进行数字设计，作为当今描述ASIC或是设计FPGA的例子。
作为这本书的前置需求，我们假设你有一些基本的布尔逻辑和二进制数系统的知识。
更多的，一些任意编程语言的编程经验也是需要的。不需要Verilog或是VHDL的知识（译者认为你最好还是会一些）。
Chisel能够成为你的第一个编程语言用来描述数字硬件。
作为例子中的搭建过程是基于sbt和make，基本的命令行界面知识（CLI，又称terminal或是Unix shell）会是有用的。

Chisel itself is not a big language. The basic constructs fit on
\myref{https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/doc/chisel-cheatsheet3.pdf}{one page}
and can be learned within a few days.
Therefore, this book is not a big book, as well.
Chisel is for sure smaller than VHDL and Verilog, which carry many legacies.
The power of Chisel comes from the embedding of Chisel within
\myref{https://www.scala-lang.org/}{Scala}, which itself in an expressive language.
Chisel inherits the feature from Scala being ``a language that grows on you''~\cite{Scala}.
However, Scala is not the topic of this book.

Chisel用来硬件设计，本身不是一个大的语言。于是，这本书也不是一本大书。Chisel应该是比VHDL和Verilog更小, 
VHDL/Verilog有很多规则。Chisel的力量来自于它是嵌入在Scala里的，Scala本身是一个有力的语言。
但是，Scala不是本书的话题。

% We provide a short section on Scala for hardware designers, but
%A general introduction to Scala is better served by
The textbook by Odersky et al.~\cite{Scala} provides a general introduction
to Scala.

我们提供了一个短的章节给硬件设计者，但是Odersky提供了一个更好的Scala导论。

This book is a tutorial in digital design and the Chisel language; it is not
a Chisel language reference, nor is it a book on complete chip design.

这本书是一个数字设计和Chisel语言的教学，不是Chisel语言的参考书籍也不是一本完整的芯片设计书

All code examples shown in this book are extracted from complete programs
that have been compiled and tested. Therefore, the code shall not contain
any syntax errors. The code examples are available from the
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-book}{GitHub repository}
of this book.
Besides showing Chisel code, we have also tried to show useful designs and
principles of good hardware description style.

所有的书中代码例子来自经过编译和测试过的程序。所以，代码不应该含有任何语法问题。
代码例子在本书的github repo里。除了提供Chisel代码以外，我也试图提供有用的设计和好的硬件描述风格的规则。


This book is optimized for reading on a laptop or tablet (e.g., an iPad).
We include links to further reading in the running text, mostly to
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/}{Wikipedia} articles.

这本书在笔电或是平板上为阅读经过了优化。我们在字里行间提供了链接，大多数是维基的文章。

\section{Installing Chisel and FPGA Tools}

Chisel is a Scala library, and the easiest way to install Chisel and Scala is
with \code{sbt}, the Scala build tool. Scala itself depends on the installation
of the \myref{https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html}{Java JDK 1.8}.

Chisel是一个Scala库，安装Chisel和Scala最简单的方法时通过sbt(Scala Build Tool)，一个用于Scala工程构建的工具。

On Mac OS X, with the packet manager \myref{https://brew.sh/}{Homebrew},
\code{sbt} is installed with:

在Mac OS X中，通过包管理软件Homerew，sbt可以通过此命令安装

\begin{verbatim}
$ brew install sbt
\end{verbatim}

\noindent For Ubuntu, which is based on Debian, programs are usually installed from a
Debian file (.deb). However, as of the time of this writing \code{sbt} is not
available as a ready to install package. Therefore, the installation process
is a little bit more involved:

对于基于Debian的Ubuntu系统，软件通常通过.deb文件进行安装。然而，当编写本文时，sbt还不能通过这种方法安装。因此，安装过程牵扯了一点点其他方式。

\begin{verbatim}
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | \
  sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 \
  --recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sbt
\end{verbatim}

Chisel and Scala can also be installed and used under Windows.
\code{sbt} can be installed with a Windows installer, see:
\myref{https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Windows.html}{Installing sbt on Windows}.

Chisel和Scala也支持Windows操作系统。
方法可以参考该网站。

To build hardware for an FPGA, you need a synthesize tool. The two major
FPGA vendors, Intel\footnote{former Altera} and Xilinx, provide free versions of
their tools that cover small to medium-sized FPGAs. Those medium-sized
FPGAs are large enough to build multicore RISC style processors.
Intel provides the \myref{https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/fpga-design/quartus-prime/download.html}{Quartus Prime Lite Edition} and Xilinx the
\myref{https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/vivado-webpack.html}{Vivado Design Suite, WebPACK Edition}.

为了构建FPGA硬件，你需要综合工具。两大主要的FPGA工具供应商，Intel和Xilinx都提供了他们免费的工具，涵盖了小容量到中等容量大小的FPGA。其中，中等规模的FPGA已经足够容纳多核RISC架构处理器。


\section{Hello World}

Each book on a programming language shall start with a minimal example,
called the \emph{Hello World} example. Following code is the first approach:

每一本编程语言书都会从叫做“Hello world”的最小例子开始。以下代码是第一种方法。


\shortlist{src/main/scala/HelloScala.scala}


\noindent Compiling and executing this short program with \code{sbt}

编译、执行这个简短的程序通过sbt：

\begin{chisel}
$ sbt "runMain HelloScala"
\end{chisel}

\noindent leads to the expected output of a Hello World program:

随后，Hollow World程序输出了预期的内容

\begin{chisel}
[info] Running HelloScala
Hello Chisel World!
\end{chisel}

\noindent However, is this Chisel? Is this hardware generated to print a string?
No, this is plain Scala code and not a representative Hello World
program for a hardware design.

然而，这就是Chisel吗？这个硬件被生成用于出书字符串？并不是这样，这里实际上是解释了Scala代码，并不代表着硬件设计的Hollo World程序。


\section{Chisel Hello World}

What is then the equivalent of a Hello World program for a hardware design?
The minimal useful and visible design? A blinking LED is the hardware (or even
embedded software) version of Hello World. If a LED blinks, we are ready to
solve bigger problems!

那么Hello World程序等价的硬件设计是什么？是最小的可用并且可视的设计？一个闪烁的LED是硬件（或者嵌入式软件）版本的Hello World。 
如果一个LED闪烁，我们就可以解决更大的问题。

\longlist{code/hello.txt}{A hardware Hello World in Chisel}{lst:chisel:hello}

Listing~\ref{lst:chisel:hello} shows a blinking LED, described in Chisel.
It is not important that you understand the details of this code example.
We will cover those in the following chapters. Just note that the circuit is
usually clocked with a high frequency, e.g., 50 MHz, and we need a counter
to derive timing in the Hz range to achieve a visible blinking. In the above
example, we count from 0 up to 25000000-1 and then toggle the blinking signal
(\code{blkReg := \textasciitilde blkReg}) and restart the counter (\code{cntReg := 0.U}).
That hardware then blinks the LED at 1~Hz.

Figure~\ref{fig:chisel:hello}展现的是一个通过Chisel描述的闪烁LED。你是否理解这个代码案例的细节是不重要的。我们将会介绍这些内容在以下的章节中。
仅仅需要注意这个电路通常有着高频率的时钟，例如50MHz，我们需要一个计数器来分频得到Hz级别的频率来实现可视化的闪烁。在这个例子中我们从0计数到25000000-1然后触发闪烁信号(\code{blkReg := \textasciitilde blkReg}) 
然后复位计数器 (\code{cntReg := 0.U})。这个硬件以1~Hz频率闪烁LED。

\section{An IDE for Chisel}

This book makes no assumptions about your programming environment or editor to use.
Learning of the basics should be easy with just using \code{sbt} at the command line
and an editor of your choice. In the tradition of other books, all commands that you
shall type in a shell/terminal/CLI are preceded by a \code{\$} character, which you
shall not type in. As an example, here is the Unix \code{ls} command, which lists files in
the current folder:
本书不对您使用的编程环境或编辑器做任何假设。
您仅在命令行中使用\ code {sbt}即可轻松学习基础知识。 按照其他书籍的传统，
你在shell / terminal / CLI中输入任何命令前键入一个\ code {\ $}字符，然后再输入，
其实不应键入。例如，这是Unix \ code {ls}命令，该命令列出了
当前文件夹：

\begin{verbatim}
$ ls
\end{verbatim}

That said, an integrated development environment (IDE), where a compiler is running in
the background, can speed up coding. As Chisel is a Scala library, all IDEs
that support Scala are also good IDEs for Chisel.
It is possible in \myref{https://www.eclipse.org/}{Eclipse} and
\myref{https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea-for-scala.html}{IntelliJ}
to generate a project from the sbt project configuration in \code{build.sbt}.
You can create an Eclipse project via
也就是说，一个集成开发环境（IDE），在其中运行编译器就可以加快编码速度。 由于Chisel是Scala库，因此所有支持Scala的IDE
也是不错的Chisel的IDE。
可以在\ myref {https://www.eclipse.org/} {Eclipse}和
\ myref{https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea-for-scala.html} {}的IntelliJ
从\ code {build.sbt}中的sbt项目配置生成一个项目。

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt eclipse
\end{verbatim}
and import that project into Eclipse.\footnote{This function needs the Eclipse plugin for sbt.}
In IntelliJ you can create a new project from existing sources and then select from \code{build.sbt}.

\myref{https://code.visualstudio.com/}{Visual Studio Code} with
\myref{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals/}{Scala Metals} requires
no setup beyond installing Visual Studio Code and the Scala Metals plugin. Scala Metals knows how to
set up everything including but not limited to code completion, Chisel source code download and
building based on \code{build.sbt}.

\section{Source Access and eBook Features}

This book is open source and hosted at GitHub: \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-book}{chisel-book}.
All Chisel code examples, shown in this book, are included in the repository.
The code compiles with a recent version of Chisel, and many examples also include a test bench.
We collect larger Chisel examples in the accompanying repository \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples}{chisel-examples}. If you find an error or typo in the book, a GitHub pull request is the most convenient way to incorporate your improvement.
You can also provide feedback or comments for improvements by filing an issue on GitHub
or sending a plain, old school email.

This book is freely available as a PDF eBook and in classical printed form.
The eBook version features links to further resources
and \myref{https://www.wikipedia.org/}{Wikipedia} entries.
We use Wikipedia entries for background information (e.g., binary number system)
that does not directly fit into this book.
We optimized the format of the eBook for reading on a tablet, such as an iPad.

\item A \myref{https://github.com/ccelio/chisel-style-guide}{Chisel Style Guide} by Christopher Celio.
\end{itemize}

\section{Exercise}

Each chapter ends with a hands-on exercise. For the introduction exercise, we will use an
FPGA board to get one \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode}{LED} blinking.
As a first step clone (or fork) the \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples}{chisel-examples}
repository from GitHub.
The Hello World example is in the folder \code{hello-world}, set up as
a minimal project. You can explore the Chisel code of the blinking LED
in \code{src/main/scala/Hello.scala}.
Compile the blinking LED with the following steps:

\begin{chisel}
$ git clone https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples.git
$ cd chisel-examples/hello-world/
$ make
\end{chisel}

After some initial downloading of Chisel components, this will produce the Verilog file \code{Hello.v}.
Explore this Verilog file. You will see that it contains two inputs \code{clock} and \code{reset}
and one output \code{io\_led}. When you compare this Verilog file with the Chisel module,
you will notice that the Chisel module does not contain \code{clock} or \code{reset}.
Those signals are implicitly generated, and in most designs, it is convenient not to need to
deal with these low-level details. Chisel provides register components, and those
are connected automatically to \code{clock} and \code{reset} (if needed).

The next step is to set up an FPGA project file for the synthesize tool, assign the pins,
and compile\footnote{The real process is more elaborated with following steps: synthesizing the logic,
performing place and route, performing timing analysis, and generating a bitfile.
However, for the purpose of this introduction example we simply call it ``compile''
your code.} the Verilog code, and configure the FPGA with the resulting bitfile.
We cannot provide the details of these steps. Please consult the manual of
your Intel Quartus or Xilinx Vivado tool.
However, the examples repository contains some ready to use Quartus
projects in folder \code{quartus} for several popular FPGA boards (e.g., DE2-115).
If the repository contains support for your board, start Quartus, open the project,
compile it by pressing the \emph{Play} button, and configure the FPGA board
with the \emph{Programmer} button and one of the LEDs should blink.

{\bf Gratulation! You managed to get your first design in Chisel running in an FPGA!}

If the LED is not blinking, check the status of reset. On the DE2-115 configuration,
the reset input is connected to SW0.

Now change the blinking frequency to a slower or a faster value and
rerun the build process. Blinking frequencies and also blinking patterns
communicate different ``emotions''. E.g., a slow blinking LED signals that
everything is ok, a fast blinking LED signals an alarm state.
Explore which frequencies express best those two different emotions.

As a more challenging extension to the exercise, generate the following blinking pattern:
the LED shall be on for 200~ms every second. For this pattern, you might
decouple the change of the LED blinking from the counter reset.
You will need a second constant where you change the state of the
\code{blkReg} register. What kind of emotion does this pattern produce?
Is it alarming or more like a sign-of-live signal?




\chapter{Basic Components}

In this section, we introduce the basic components for digital design:
combinational circuits and flip-flops.
These essential elements can be combined to build larger, more interesting circuits.

在这个章节，我们介绍数字设计的组成部分。这些基本的组成部分可以被合并到更大，更有趣的电路中。

\section{Signal Types and Constants}

Chisel provides three data types to describe signals, combinational logic, and registers:
\code{Bits}, \code{UInt}, and \code{SInt}. \code{UInt} and \code{SInt} extend \code{Bits},
and all three types represent a vector of bits. \code{UInt} gives this vector of
bits the meaning of an unsigned integer and \code{SInt} of a signed
integer.\footnote{The type \codefoot{Bits} in the current version of Chisel is missing operations and
therefore not very useful for user code.}
Chisel uses \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two\%27s\_complement}{two's complement}
as signed integer representation.
Here is the definition for different types, an 8-bit \code{Bits}, an 8-bit unsigned integer, and a 10-bit
signed integer:

Chisel提供了三种数据类型用来描述型号，组合逻辑，和寄存器：Bits， UInts，和SInt。
UInt和SInt是Bits的拓展，并且所有的三种类型代表bits的矢量。UInts表示这个bits的矢量是一个无符号的整型，SInt表示一个有符号的整型。Chisel使用二补数表示有符号数的整型。以下是不同类型的定义，8位Bits，8位无符号整型，和一个10位有符号整型：

\noindent The width of a vector of bits is defined by a Chisel width type (\code{Width}).
The following expression casts the Scala integer \code{n} to a Chisel \code{width},
which is used for the definition of the \code{Bits} vector:

Bits的矢量宽度被Chisel的width类型定义。以下表示把scala的整型n转换成Chisel的宽度，用于Bits矢量的定义。

\shortlist{code/n_w.txt}

\noindent Constants can be defined by using a Scala integer and converting it to a Chisel type:

常量可以通过Scala整型定义并把它转换成Chisel类型。定义一个为0的UInt常量，和定义一个为03的SInt常量。

\shortlist{code/constants.txt}

\noindent Constants can also be defined with a width, by using the Chisel width type:

常量也可以随着宽度被定义，使用Chisel的width类型。 定义一个4位的常量8。

\shortlist{code/const_width.txt}

\noindent If you find the notion of 8.U and 4.W a little bit funny, consider it as a variant of an integer
constant with a type. This notation is similar to 8L, representing a long integer constant in C, Java, and Scala.

当你发现8.U和4.W的表示方式有些有趣，你可以认为它是一个整型常量附带一个类型。这个表示方式类似于8L，代表一个C，Java或Scala中的长整型。

Chisel benefits from Scala's type inference and in many places type information can be left out.
The same is also valid for bit widths. In many cases, Chisel will automatically infer the correct width.
Therefore, a Chisel description of hardware is more concise and better readable than VHDL or
Verilog.

Chisel受益于Scala的类型推断，并且很多地方类型信息可以被省略。类似的也适用于位宽。在很多时候，Chisel会自动推断正确的宽度。于是，chisel描述的硬件语言比VHDL或Verilog更加简洁和可读。

For constants defined in other bases than decimal, the constant is defined in a string with
a preceding \code{h} for hexadecimal (base 16), \code{o} for octal (base 8), and \code{b}
for binary (base 2). The following example shows the definition of constant 255 in different
bases. In this example we omit the bit width and Chisel infers the minimum width to fit
the constants in, in this case 8 bits.

对于以其它作为基底的十进制以外的常量，常量被定义为字符串，开头h是16进制，o是8进制，b是2进制。以下的例子表明了常量255的定义，在不同的基底。在这个例子，我们省略了位宽，chisel推断了最小宽度用来表示常量，在这个例子是8位。（16进制表示255， 8进制表示255， 二进制表示255）


\shortlist{code/const_base.txt}

\noindent The above code shows how to use an underscore to group digits in the
string that represents a constant. The underscore is ignored.

以上代码也表示了如何使用下划线去群组数字来标识常量。下划线是被忽略的。

To represent logic values, Chisel defines the type \code{Bool}.
\code{Bool} can represent a \emph{true} or \emph{false} value.
The following code shows the definition of type \code{Bool} and the definition of
\code{Bool} constants, by converting the Scala Boolean constants \code{true}
and \code{false} to Chisel \code{Bool} constants.

为了表示逻辑值，Chisel定义了Bool类型。Bool可以表示true或false值，以下的代码表示了Bool类型的定义以及Bool常量的定义，通过转换Scala Boolean常量true和false， 到Chisel的Bool类型。


\shortlist{code/bool.txt}


\section{Combinational Circuits}

Chisel uses \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra}{Boolean algebra} operators,
as they are defined in C, Java, Scala, and several other programming languages,
to described combinational circuits: \code{\&} is the AND operator and \code{|} is
the OR operator.
Following line of code defines a circuit that combines signals \code{a} and \code{b} with \emph{and}
gates and combines the result with signal \code{c} with \emph{or} gates.

Chisel使用布尔逻辑操作符，和C，Java，Scala和可能很多其它编程语言中定义的一样，去描述组合电路。以下代码定义了一个对a和b进行与逻辑，然后把它的结果和c进行或逻辑的电路：


\shortlist{code/logic.txt}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/logic}
  \caption{Logic for the expression \code{(a \& b) | c}.
  The wires can be a single bit or multiple bits. The Chisel expression, and the schematics are the same.}
  \label{fig:logic}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:logic} shows the schematic of this combinatorial expression.
Note that this circuit may be for a vector of bits and not only single wires
that are combined with the AND and OR circuits.

In this example, we do not define the type nor the width of signal \code{logic}.
Both are inferred from the type and width of the expression.
The standard logic operations in Chisel are:

\shortlist{code/bool_ops.txt}

在这个例子中我们没有定义类型也没有定义信号logic的宽度。这两个从表达式的type和width中推断而来。标准Chisel的逻辑操作是：
1. 按位与
2. 按位或
3. 按位异或
4. 按位取反（译者：这个和！有区别的，注意）

\noindent The arithmetic operations use the standard operators:

\shortlist{code/arith_ops.txt}

算术操作使用标准操作符1. 加法 2. 减法 3. 相反数 4. 乘法 5. 除法 6. 余数：

\noindent The resulting width of the operation is the maximum width of the operators for
addition and subtraction, the sum of the two widths for the multiplication, and usually
the width of the numerator for divide and modulo operations.\footnote{The exact
details are available in the \myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/firrtl/blob/master/spec/spec.pdf}{FIRRTL specification}.}

加法和减法操作结果的宽度是操作数的最大宽度，乘法操作结果的库纳杜是两个操作数的位宽加和, 除法和余数操作的结果是被除数的位宽。

A signal can also first be defined as a \code{Wire} of some type. Afterward, we can assign a
value to the wire with the \code{:=} update operator.

\shortlist{code/wire.txt}

A single bit can be extracted as follows:
\shortlist{code/single_bit.txt}

\noindent A subfield can be extracted from end to start position:
\shortlist{code/sub_field.txt}

\noindent Bit fields are concatenated with \code{Cat}.
\shortlist{code/concat.txt}

Table~\ref{tab:operators} shows the full list of operators
(see also \myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/wiki/Builtin-Operators}{builtin operators}).
The Chisel operator precedence is determined by the evaluation order of the circuit,
which follows the \myref{https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/operators.html}{Scala operator precedence}.
If in doubt, it is always a good praxis to use parentheses.\footnote{The operator precedence in
Chisel is a side effect of the hardware elaboration when the tree of hardware nodes
is created by executing the Scala operators. The Scala operator precedence is similar but
not identical to Java/C. Verilog has the same operator precedence as C, but VHDL
has a different one. Verilog has precedence ordering for logic operations, but in VHDL
those operators have the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right.}

Table~\ref{tab:functions} shows various functions defined on and for Chisel data types.

\begin{table}

 \label{tab:operators}

\subsection{Multiplexer}

A \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer}{multiplexer} is a circuit that selects between alternatives.
In the most basic form, it selects between two alternatives. Figure~\ref{fig:mux} shows
such a 2:1 multiplexer, or mux for short. Depending on the value of the
select signal (\code{sel}) signal \code{y} will represent signal \code{a} or
signal \code{b}.

选择器是一个选择选项的电路。在最基本的形式，它在二者选择其一。图2.2表示一个二选一复用器，或是用mux简单表示。取决于选择信号sel，y会表示选择的信号是a或是信号b。


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/mux}
  \caption{A basic 2:1 multiplexer.}
  \label{fig:mux}
\end{figure}

A multiplexer can be built from logic.
However, as multiplexing  is such a standard operation, Chisel provides a multiplexer,

一个选择器可以通过逻辑简单搭建。但是，复用是一个常用操作，Chisel提供了一个选择器。

\shortlist{code/mux.txt}

\noindent where \code{a} is selected when the \code{sel} is \code{true.B}, otherwise \code{b}
is selected. The type of \code{sel} is a Chisel \code{Bool}; the inputs \code{a} and \code{b}
can be any Chisel base type or aggregate (bundles or vectors) as long as they are the same
type.

这里如果sel是true.B的话，选择a，反之选择b。sel的类型是Chisel Bool， a和b作为输入可以是任何Chisel基本类型或是集合（捆束或是矢量），只要它们的类型相同。

With logical and arithmetical operations and a multiplexer, every combinational
circuit can be described. However, Chisel provides further components and control abstractions
for a more elegant description of a combinational circuit, which are described in
a later chapter.

通过逻辑和算术操作，一个复用器，每个组合电路都能被描述。但是，Chisel提供了更多部分和控制的抽象用来更优雅地描述组合电路，这些在稍后章节讲。


The second basic component needed to describe a digital circuit is a state element,
also called register, which is described next.

第二个需要描述一个数字电路的基本组成部分是一个状态单元，又称寄存器，下边讲。

\section{Registers}

Chisel provides a register, which is a collection of
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop\_(electronics)\#D\_flip-flop}{D flip-flops}.
The register is implicitly connected to a global clock and is updated on the rising edge.
When an initialization value is provided at the declaration of the register,
it uses a synchronous reset connected to a global reset signal.

Chisel提供了一个寄存器，这是一个D型触发器的集合。这个寄存器隐含连接到一个总时钟，并且上升触发。当一个初始值随着在寄存器声明的时候被提供，它使用的是一个同步复位，连接到总复位信号。

A register can be any Chisel type that can be represented as a collection of bits.
Following code defines an 8-bit register, initialized with 0 at reset:

一个寄存器可以是任何bits集合的Chisel类型。下边的代码定义了一个八位寄存器，在复位初始化为0。



\shortlist{code/register.txt}

\noindent An input is connected to the register with the \code{:=} update operator and
the output of the register can be used just with the name in an expression:

一个输入连接到寄存器，通过:=更新操作数，输出的寄存器可以使用表达式通过名字调用。

\shortlist{code/reg_con.txt}

\noindent A register can also be connected to its input at the definition:

寄存器也可以连接到它的输入使用如下定义: 

\shortlist{code/reg_next.txt}

\noindent A register can also be connected to its input and a constant as
initial value at the definition:

也可以连接到它的输入并使用一个常量作为初始值作为定义:

\shortlist{code/reg_both.txt}

\noindent To distinguish between signals representing combinational logic and registers,
a common practice is to postfix register names with \code{Reg}.
Another common practice, coming from Java and Scala, is to use
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case}{camelCase} for
identifier consisting of several words. The convention is to start
functions and variables with a lower case and classes (types) with
an upper case.

为了区分表示组合逻辑和寄存器的信号，一个常见的方式是在寄存器前边加上前缀ref。另一个常见的方式，来自Java和Scala，市区使用camelCase，由几个单词组成的标识。这个方式是函数和变量用首字母小写，类用首字母大写。


\subsection{Counting}

Counting is a fundamental operation in digital systems. On might count events.
However, more often counting is used to define a time interval. Counting the
clock cycles and triggering an action when the time interval has expired.

计数是一个非常基本的操作在数字系统。计数可能时常发生。但是，经常计数是被使用去定义一个时间间隔。计数时钟，并引发一个操作，当时间间隔过期的时候。


A simple approach is counting up to a value. However, in computer science,
and digital design, counting starts at 0. Therefore, if we want to count till
10, we count from 0 to 9. The following code shows such a counter that counts
till 9 and wraps around to 0 when reaching 9.

一个简单的方式是计数到一个值。但是，在计算机科学和数字设计，计数从0开始。于是，如果我们想要数到10，我们是从0数到9.以下代码表示一个计数器，数到9，并返回到0当数到9的时候。


\shortlist{code/counter.txt}

\section{Structure with Bundle and Vec}

Chisel provides two constructs to group related signals: (1) a \code{Bundle} to group
signals of different types and (2) a \code{Vec} to represent an indexable collection of signals
of the same type.
Chisel提供了两种将相关信号分组的结构：（1）\ code {Bundle}进行分组不同类型的信号和（2）\ code {Vec}来表示信号的可索引集合
相同类型的。
\code{Bundle}s and \code{Vec}s can be arbitrarily nested.
\ code {Bundle}和\ code {Vec}可以任意嵌套。

A Chisel bundle groups several signals. The entire bundle can be referenced
as a whole, or individual fields can be accessed by their name.
We can define a bundle (collection of signals) by defining a class that
extends \code{Bundle} and list the fields as \code{val}s within the constructor block.
Chisel 中bundle可以将多个信号分组。 整个包都可以引用。
对整体而言，也可以按名称访问各个字段。
我们可以通过定义一个类来定义一个bundle（信号集合）
扩展\ code {Bundle}并在构造函数块内将字段作为\ code {val}列出。


\shortlist{code/bundle.txt}

\noindent To use a bundle, we create it with \code{new} and wrap it into a \code{Wire}.
The fields are accessed with the dot notation:
要使用包，我们使用\ code {new}创建它，并将其包装到\ code {Wire}中。
使用点符号访问这些字段：

\shortlist{code/bundle_use.txt}

Dot notation is common in object-oriented languages, where \code{x.y} means
\code{x} is a reference to an object and \code{y} is a field of that object.
As Chisel is object-oriented, we use dot notation to access fields in a bundle.
A bundle is similar to a \code{struct} in C, a \code{record} in VHDL, or a
\code{struct} in SystemVerilog.
点表示法在面向对象的语言中很常见，其中\ code {x.y}表示
\ code {x}是对对象的引用，\ code {y}是该对象的字段。
由于Chisel是面向对象的，因此我们使用点表示法来访问包中的字段。
捆绑包类似于C中的\ code {struct}，VHDL中的\ code {record}或
SystemVerilog中的\ code {struct}。
A bundle can also be referenced as a whole:

\shortlist{code/bundle_ref.txt}

A Chisel \code{Vec} represents a collection of signals of the same type (a vector).
Each element can be accessed by an index. A Chisel \code{Vec} is similar
to array data structures in other programing languages.\footnote{The name \codefoot{Array}
is already used in Scala.}
A \code{Vec} is created by calling the constructor with two parameters: the
number of elements and the type of the elements. A combinational \code{Vec}
needs to be wrapped into a \code{Wire}

\shortlist{code/vec.txt}

\noindent Individual elements are accessed with \code{(index)}.

\shortlist{code/vec_access.txt}

A vector wrapped into a \code{Wire} is a multiplexer.
We can also wrap a vector into a register to define an array of registers.
Following example defines a register file for a processor; 32 registers
each 32-bits wide, as for a classic 32-bit 
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer}{RISC}
processor, like the 32-bit version of \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V}{RISC-V}.

\shortlist{code/reg_file.txt}

\noindent An element of that register file is accessed with an index and used as a normal register.

\shortlist{code/reg_file_access.txt}

We can freely mix bundles and vectors. When creating a vector with a bundle
type, we need to pass a prototype for the vector fields. Using our
\code{Channel}, which we defined above, we can create a vector of channels with:

\shortlist{code/vec_bundle.txt}

\noindent A bundle may as well contain a vector:

\shortlist{code/bundle_vec.txt}

When we want a register of a bundle type that needs a reset value,
we first create a \code{Wire} of that bundle, set the individual fields
as needed, and then passing this bundle to a \code{RegInit}:

\shortlist{code/bundle_reg_init.txt}

With combinations of \code{Bundle}s and \code{Vec}s we can define our own data
structures, which are powerful abstractions.

\section{Chisel Generates Hardware}

After seeing some initial Chisel code, it might look similar to classic programming
languages such as Java or C. However, Chisel (or any other hardware description
language) does define hardware components. While in a software program one
line of code after the other is executed, in hardware all lines of code
\emph{execute in parallel}.

It is essential to keep in mind that Chisel code does generate hardware.
Try to imagine, or draw on a sheet of paper, the individual blocks that
are generated by your Chisel circuit description.
Each creation of a component adds hardware; each assignment statement
generates gates and/or flip-flops.

必须记住，Chisel代码确实会生成硬件。
尝试想象或画在纸上的单个块
由您的Chisel电路描述生成。
每次创建组件都会添加硬件。每个赋值声明
产生门和/或触发器。

More technically, when Chisel executes your code it runs as a Scala program, and
by executing the Chisel statements, it \emph{collects} the hardware components
and connects those nodes. This network of hardware nodes is the hardware,
which can spill out Verilog code for ASIC or FPGA synthesis or can be
tested with a Chisel tester.
The network of hardware nodes is what is executed in fully parallel.


从技术上讲，Chisel执行代码时，它将作为Scala程序运行，并且
通过执行Chisel语句，它\emph{collects}硬件组件
并连接这些节点。硬件节点网络就是硬件，
可能会溢出用于ASIC或FPGA综合的Verilog代码，或者
用Chisel测试仪测试。
硬件节点网络是完全并行执行的。

For a software engineer imagine this immense parallelism that you can
create in hardware without needing to partition your application into threads
and getting the locking correct for the communication.


对于软件工程师，可以想象一下，您可以
在硬件中创建，而无需将应用程序划分为线程
并正确锁定通信。

\section{Exercise}

In the introduction you implemented a blinking LED on an FPGA board
(from \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples}{chisel-examples}), which is a reasonable
hardware \emph{Hello World} example. It used only internal state, a single LED output, and no input.
Copy that project into a new folder and extend it by adding some inputs to the \code{io} \code{Bundle}
with \code{val sw = Input(UInt(2.W))}.

在导论中，你补充了一个闪烁的LED在一个FPGA板上（来自chisel-example），这个是一个类似硬件Hello world的例子。它只是使用内部的状态，一个LED输出，没有输入。把那个项目复制到一个新的文件夹，并使用val sw = Input(UInt(2.W))添加一些输入到io捆束。


\shortlist{code/basic_exercise.txt}

\noindent For those switches, you also need to assign the pin names for the FPGA board.
You can find examples of pin assignments in the Quartus project files of the ALU project
(e.g., for the \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/blob/master/quartus/altde2-115/alu.qsf}{DE2-115
FPGA board}).

对于这些开关，你也可以给FPGA板上的PIN分配名字。你可以找到管脚命名的例子在Quartus项目文件中的ALU项目（例如，DE2-115 FPGA 板子）。

When you have defined those inputs and the pin assignment, start with a simple test:
drop all blinking logic from the design and connect one switch to the LED output;
compile and configure the FPGA device. Can you switch the LED on an off with the switch?
If yes, you have now inputs available. If not, you need to debug your FPGA configuration.
The pin assignment can also be done with the GUI version of the tool.

当你已经定义了这些输入和管脚分配，开始一个简单的测试：关掉设计中所有闪烁逻辑，连接其中一个到LED输出；编译并设置FPGA期间。你可以通过开关把LED打开并关闭吗？如果是对的，你就有了可用的输入。如果没有，你需要给你的FPGA设置debug。这个也可以通过GUI版本的工具完成。


Now use two switches and implement one of the basic combinational functions,
e.g., AND two switches and show the result on the LED. Change the function.
The next step involves three input switches to implement a multiplexer: one acts as
a select signal, and the other two are the two inputs for the 2:1 multiplexer.

现在使用两个开关并完成一个基本的组合电路函数，例如，二输入与门并在LED显示结果。改变函数。下一步包括三输入开关来完成一个复用器，一个充当选择信号，另外两个充当双输入复用器的输入。


Now you have been able to implement simple combinational functions and test them
in real hardware in an FPGA. As a next step, we will take a first look at how the build
process works to generate an FPGA configuration. Furthermore, we will also
explore a simple testing framework from Chisel, which allows you to test circuits
without configuring an FPGA and toggle switches.

现在你已经可以补充简单的组合函数并在一个实际的FPGA进行简单的测试。作为下一步，我们会看一下搭建过程如何生成FPGA设置。更多地，我们也会探索一个简单的Chisel测试框架，这允许你不去设置FPGA和开关来测试电路。


\chapter{Build Process and Testing}

To get started with more interesting Chisel code we first need to learn how to compile
Chisel programs, how to generate Verilog code for execution in an FPGA, and how
to write tests for debugging and to verify that our circuits are correct.

为了开始更有趣的Chisel代码，我们第一需要学习如何编译Chisel程序，如何生成Verilog代码用来在FPGA执行，和如何写测试用于debug和验证我们的电路是正确的。


Chisel is written in Scala, so any build process that supports Scala is possible
with a Chisel project. One popular build tool for Scala is \myref{https://www.scala-sbt.org/}{sbt},
which stands for the Scala interactive build tool.
Besides driving the build and test process, \code{sbt} also downloads the correct
version of Scala and the Chisel libraries.

Chisel是用Scala写的，所以任何的支持Scala的搭建过程适用于Chisel项目。一个受欢迎的Scala搭建工具是sbt，sbt是Scala interactive Build Tool的简写。除了驱动搭建和测试过程，sbt也下载正确的Scala版本和Chisel 库。


\section{Building your Project with sbt}

The Scala library that represents Chisel and the Chisel testers are automatically
downloaded during the build process from a Maven repository.
The libraries are referenced by \code{build.sbt}. It is possible to configure \code{build.sbt}
with \code{latest.release} to always use the most actual version of Chisel.
However, this means on each build the version is looked up from the Maven
repository. This lookup needs an Internet connection for the build to succeed.
Better use a dedicated version of Chisel and all other Scala libraries in your \code{build.sbt}.
Maybe sometimes it is also good to be able to write hardware code and test it without an Internet connection.
For example, it is cool to do hardware design on a plane.

Scala 库中表示Chisel和Chisel测试器的部分，是通过搭建过程从一个Maven仓库中下载的。库文件通过build.sbt被引用。它可以通过build.sbt设置，使用latest.release总是用最新的Chisel'版本。但是，这意味这每次搭建都要查看Maven仓库。查看需要互联网连接，为了搭建成功。最好使用一个特定的Chisel版本，所有其它的Scala库在你的build.sbt。可能有的时候你能够手写硬件代码并且在无网络连接的情况下测试是值得提倡的。例如，在飞机上进行硬件设计，酷。


\subsection{Source Organization}

\code{sbt} inherits the source convention from the \myref{https://maven.apache.org/}{Maven}
build automation tool. Maven also organizes repositories of open-source Java libraries.\footnote{That is
also the place where you downloaded the Chisel library on your first build:
\url{https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/edu.berkeley.cs/chisel3}.}

sbt继承来自于Maven自动化搭建工具的源文件法则。Maven也管理者开源Java函数库的仓库。

}
\caption{Source tree of a Chisel project (using \code{sbt})}
\label{fig:folders}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:folders} shows the organization of the source tree of a typical Chisel project.
The root of the project is the project home, which contains \code{build.sbt}.
It may also include a \code{Makefile} for the build process, a README, and a LICENSE file.
Folder \code{src} contains all source code. From there it is split between \code{main},
containing the hardware sources and \code{test} containing testers.
Chisel inherits from Scala, which inherits from Java the organization of source
in \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_package}{packages}.
Packages organize your Chisel code into namespaces. Packages can also contain
sub-packages.
The folder \code{target} contains the class files and other generated files.
I recommend to also use a folder for generated Verilog files, which is usually
call \code{generated}.

图3.1表示了一个常见的Chisel项目的源文件树的结构。
项目的根目录是项目home地址，这里包含了build.sbt。
也可以包含一个Makefile用于搭建过程，一个README，和一个LICENSE文件。
文件夹sec包含了所有源代码。
在这里，main包含硬件源代码和test包含测试器，有一个分叉。
Chisel继承自Scala，Scala继承自Java的源文件软件包的结构。
软件包把你的Chisel代码组织成命名空间。软件包也可以包括下属软件包。
文件夹target包括类文件和其它产生的文件。
我也推荐用一个文件放置生成的Verilog文件，这个文件夹一般称为generated。


To use the facility of namespaces in Chisel, you need to declare that a class/module
is defined in a package, in this example in \code{mypacket}:

为了使用Chisel命名空间的工具，你需要声明类或模块在软件包被定义，在这个例子里，在mypack:

\shortlist{code/packet.txt}

\noindent Note that in this example we see the import of the \code{chisel3} packet
to use Chisel classes.

注意在这个例子我们看到引入chisel3软件包，和使用chisel类

To use the module \code{Abc} in a different context (packet name space),
the components of packet \code{mypacket} need to be imported. The underscore
(\_) acts as wildcard, meaning that all classes of \code{mypacket} are imported.

为了使用Abc莫款在一个不同的地方（软件包命名空间），软件包的mypack需要被引用。下划线（_）充当万用字元，意味着所有mypack的类都要被引用。


\shortlist{code/usepacket.txt}

\noindent It is also possible to not import all types from \code{mypacket},
but use the fully qualified name \code{mypack.Abc} to refer to the module
\code{Abc} in packet \code{mypack}.

也可以不去引用来自mypack的所有类别，而是使用全名mypack.Abc代表mypack中的模块Abc

\shortlist{code/usepacket2.txt}

\noindent It is also possible to import just a single class and create an instance of it:

引用只是一个单个的类，并创造它也是可以的：

\shortlist{code/usepacket3.txt}


\subsection{Running sbt}

A Chisel project can be compiled and executed with a simple \code{sbt} command:

一个Chisel项目可以被编译并执行通过一个简单的sbt命令：

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt run
\end{verbatim}

This command will compile all your Chisel code from the source tree and searches
for classes that contain an \code{object} that includes a \code{main} method, or simpler
that extends \code{App}. If there is more than one such object, all objects are listed and
one can be selected.
You can also directly specify the object that shall be executed as a parameter to \code{sbt}:

这个命令会编译你所有的源文件树下的Chisel代码并搜索含有object和含有main方法的类别，或是简化的App。
如果由多余一个类似的对象，所有的对象都会被列出以及可选。
你也可以直接执行被传入sbt作为参数的对象：


\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt "runMain mypacket.MyObject"
\end{verbatim}

Per default \code{sbt} searches only the \code{main} part of the source tree and not
the \code{test} part.\footnote{This is a convention form Java/Scala that the test folder contains
unit tests and not objects with a \codefoot{main}.} However, Chisel testers, as described here,
contain a \code{main}, but shall be placed in the \code{test} part of the source tree.
To execute a \code{main} in the tester tree use following \code{sbt} command:

根据默认sbt只是搜索main部分的源文件树而不是测试部分。
但是，Chisel测试器，在这里描述的，含有一个main，但是应该放在源文件树的test部分。
为了执行测试树的main，使用如下sbt命令：

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt "test:runMain mypacket.MyTester"
\end{verbatim}

Now that we know the basic structure of a Chisel project and how to compile and run it
with \code{sbt}, we can continue with a simple testing framework.

现在我们知道了Chisel项目的基本构成和如何使用sbt编译运行，我们可以继续开始一个简单的测试框架了。
    
\section{Testing with Chisel}

Tests of hardware designs are usually called \myref{https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx10/isehelp/ise_c_simulation_test_bench.htm}{test benches}.
The test bench instantiates the design under test (DUT), drives input ports, observes output ports,
and compares them with expected values.

测试硬件设计一般称为testbench。
这些testbench初始化被测试的设计（DUT），驱动输入端口，观察输出端口，与它们和期待值比较。

Chisel provides test benches in the form of a \code{PeekPokeTester}.
One strength of Chisel is that it can use the full power of Scala to write those
test benches. One can, for example, code the expected functionality of the hardware
in a software simulator and compare the simulation of the hardware with the
software simulation. This method is very efficient when testing an implementation
of a processor~\cite{lipsi:arcs2018}.

Chisel提供的testbench叫PeekPokeTester。
其中Chisel的一个优势是它能够全力使用Scala写入这些testbench。
一个人，比方说，可以在软件模拟器编写期望的硬件功能，并把硬件仿真和软件仿真进行比较。
这个方法是非常有效的，当测试写好的处理器的时候。

To use the \code{PeekPokeTester}, following packages need to be imported:

使用PeekPokeTester，以下软件包需要引入：

\shortlist{code/test_import.txt}

\noindent Testing a circuit contains (at least) three components: (1) the device under test (often
called DUT), (2) the testing logic, also called test bench, and (3) the tester objects
that contains the \code{main} function to start the testing.

测试电路需要（至少）三个部分：1. 接受测试的器件（经常称为DUT）2. 测试逻辑，也称testbench 3. 包含main函数的测试对象用来开始测试。

The following code shows our simple design under test. It contains two input
ports and one output port, all with a 2-bit width. The circuit does a bit-wise AND
to it returns on the output:

以下代码表明了我们简单的接受测试的设计。它包含输入端口和一个输出端口，全是2位宽的。这个电路执行按位AND并返回给输出：

\shortlist{code/test_dut.txt}

\noindent The test bench for this DUT extends \code{PeekPokeTester} and has
the DUT as a parameter for the constructor:

该DUT的testbench拓展了PeekPokeTester，并把DUT作为建造器的参数：

\shortlist{code/test_bench_simple.txt}

\noindent A \code{PeekPokeTester} can set input values with \code{poke()} and
read back output values with \code{peek()}. The tester advances the simulation by one
step (= one clock cycle) with \code{step(1)}.
We can print the values of the outputs with \code{println()}.

The test is created and run with the following tester main:

\shortlist{code/test_main_simple.txt}

\noindent When you run the test, you will see the results printed to the terminal
(besides other information):

\begin{verbatim}
[info] [0.004] SEED 1544207645120
[info] [0.008] Result is: 0
[info] [0.009] Result is: 2
test DeviceUnderTest Success: 0 tests passed in 7 cycles
taking 0.021820 seconds
[info] [0.010] RAN 2 CYCLES PASSED
\end{verbatim}

\noindent We see that 0 AND 1 results in 0; 3 AND 2 results in 2.
Besides manually inspecting printouts, which is an excellent starting point, we can also
express our expectations in the test bench itself with \code{expect()},
having the output port and the expected value as parameters.
The following example shows testing with \code{expect()}:

\shortlist{code/test_bench.txt}

\noindent Executing this test does not print out any values from the hardware,
but that all tests passed as all expect values are correct.

\begin{verbatim}
[info] [0.001] SEED 1544208437832
test DeviceUnderTest Success: 2 tests passed in 7 cycles
taking 0.018000 seconds
[info] [0.009] RAN 2 CYCLES PASSED
\end{verbatim}

\noindent A failed test, when either the DUT or the test bench contains an error,
produces an error message describing the difference between the expected and actual
value. In the following, we changed the test bench to expect a 4, which is an error:

\begin{verbatim}
[info] [0.002] SEED 1544208642263
[info] [0.011] EXPECT AT 2   io_out got 0 expected 4 FAIL
test DeviceUnderTest Success: 1 tests passed in 7 cycles
taking 0.022101 seconds
[info] [0.012] RAN 2 CYCLES FAILED FIRST AT CYCLE 2
\end{verbatim}

In this section, we described the basic testing facility with Chisel for simple tests.
However, in Chisel, the full power of Scala is available to write testers.
\todo{Have a link to the not yet written section for: We will show these possibilities later.}

在本节中，我们描述了Chisel用于简单测试的基本测试工具。
但是，在Chisel中，Scala的全部功能可用于编写测试人员。

\myref{http://www.scalatest.org/}{ScalaTest} is a testing tool for Scala (and Java),
which we can use to run Chisel testers.
To use it, include the library in your \code{build.sbt} with the following line:

\begin{verbatim}
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.0.5" % "test"
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Tests are usually found in \code{src/test/scala} and can be run with:

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt test
\end{verbatim}

\noindent A minimal test (a testing hello world) to test a Scala Integer
addition:

\shortlist{code/scalatest_hello_world.txt}

\noindent Although Chisel testing is more heavyweight than unit testing of Scala programs,
we can wrap a Chisel test into a ScalaTest class. For the \code{Tester} shown
before this is:


尽管Chisel测试比Scala程序的单元测试更重要，我们可以将Chisel测试包装到ScalaTest类中。对于显示的Tester
在此之前：

\shortlist{code/scalatest_simple.txt}

The main benefit of this exercise is to be able to run all tests with a simple
\code{sbt test} (instead of a running \code{main}). You can run just a single
test with \code{sbt}, as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt "testOnly SimpleSpec"
\end{verbatim}

\section{Exercises}

For this exercise, we will revisit the blinking LED from
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples}{chisel-examples}
and explore Chisel testing. \todo{Also use the ALU example.}

\subsection{A Minimal Project}

First, let us find out what a minimal Chisel project is. Explore the files in the
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/tree/master/hello-world}{Hello World}
example.
The \code{Hello.scala} is the single hardware source file.
It contains the hardware description of the blinking LED (\code{class Hello})
and an \code{App} that generates the Verilog code.

Each file starts with the import of Chisel and related packages:

\shortlist{code/import.txt}

\noindent Then follows the hardware description, as shown in Listing~\ref{lst:chisel:hello}.
To generate the Verilog description, we need an application. A Scala object that \code{extends App}
is an application that implicitly generates the main function where the application starts.
The only action of this application is to create a new \code{HelloWorld} object and pass it
to the Chisel driver \code{execute} function. The first argument is an array of Strings,
where build options can be set (e.g., the output folder). The following code will
generate the Verilog file \code{Hello.v}.

\shortlist{code/generate.txt}

\noindent Run the generation of the example manually with

\begin{chisel}
$ sbt "runMain Hello"
\end{chisel}

and explore the generated \code{Hello.v} with an editor. The generated Verilog code may not be
very readable, but we can find out some details. The file starts with a module \code{Hello},
which is the same name as our Chisel module. We can identify our LED port as
\code{output io\_led}. Pin names are the Chisel names with a prepended \code{io\_}.
Besides our LED pin, the module also contains \code{clock} and \code{reset} input signals.
Those two signals are added automatically by Chisel.

Furthermore, we can identify the definition of our two registers \code{cntReg} and \code{blkReg}.
We may also find the reset and update of those registers at the end of the module definition.
Note, that Chisel generates a synchronous reset.

For \code{sbt} to be able to fetch the correct Scala compiler and the Chisel library,
we need a \code{build.sbt}:

\begin{chisel}
scalaVersion := "2.11.7"

resolvers ++= Seq(
  Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots"),
  Resolver.sonatypeRepo("releases")
)

libraryDependencies += "edu.berkeley.cs" %% "chisel3" % "3.1.2"
\end{chisel}

\noindent Note that in this example, we have a concrete Chisel version number to avoid checking on
each run for a new version (which will fail if we are not connected to the Internet,
e.g., when doing hardware design during a flight).
Change the \code{build.sbt} configuration to use the latest Chisel version by changing the
library dependency to

\begin{chisel}
libraryDependencies += "edu.berkeley.cs" %% "chisel3" % "latest.release"
\end{chisel}

\noindent and rerun the build with \code{sbt}. Is there a newer version of Chisel
available and will it be automatically downloaded?

For convenience, the project also contains a \code{Makefile}.
It just contains the \code{sbt} command, so we do not need to remember it and
can generate the Verilog code with:

\begin{chisel}
make
\end{chisel}

%The project also contains a
%\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/blob/master/hello-world/verilog/hello_top.v}{Verilog top level},
%which wires the reset signal to 0.
%This works for our example in an FPGA, as registers usually power up 0.
Besides a \code{README} file, the example project also contains project
files for different FPGA board. E.g., in
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/tree/master/hello-world/quartus/altde2-115}{quartus/altde2-115} 
you can find the two project files to define a Quartus project for the DE2-115 board.
The main definitions (source files, device, pin assignments) can be found in a plain text file
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/blob/master/hello-world/quartus/altde2-115/hello.qsf}{hello.qsf}.
Explore the file and find out which pins are connected to which signals.
If you need to adapt the project to a different board, there is where the changes are applied.
If you have Quartus installed, open that project, compile with the green \emph{Play} button,
and then configure the FPGA.

Note that the \emph{Hello World} is a minimal Chisel project.
More realistic projects have their source files organized in packages and contain testers.
The next exercise will explore such a project.

\subsection{A Testing Exercise}

In the last chapter's exercise, you have extended the blinking LED example with some input
to build an AND gate and a multiplexer and run this hardware in an FPGA.
We will now use this example and test the functionality with a Chisel tester
to automate testing and also to be independent of an FPGA.
Use your designs from the previous chapter and add a Chisel tester to test the functionality.
Try to enumerate all possible inputs and test the output with \code{except()}.

在上一章的练习中，您通过一些输入扩展了LED闪烁的示例
来构建一个“与”门和一个多路复用器，并在FPGA中运行该硬件。
现在，我们将使用此示例，并使用Chisel测试仪测试功能
自动化测试并独立于FPGA。
使用上一章中的设计并添加Chisel测试器以测试功能。
尝试枚举所有可能的输入，并使用except测试输出。

Testing within Chisel can speed up the debugging of your design.
However, it is always a good idea to synthesize your design for an FPGA and run tests
with the FPGA. There you can perform a reality check on the size of your design (usually
in LUTs and flip-flops) and your performance of your design in maximum clocking frequency.
As a reference point, a textbook style pipelined RISC processor may consume about 3000
4-bit LUTs and may run around 100~MHz in a low-cost FPGA (Intel Cyclone or
Xilinx Spartan).


在Chisel中进行测试可以加快设计的调试速度。
但是，将您的设计综合到FPGA并运行测试始终是一个好主意。
FPGA。在那里，您可以检查设计的大小（通常是
（在LUT和触发器中），以及您在最大时钟频率下的设计性能。
作为参考，教科书式流水RISC处理器可能消耗约3000
4位LUT，可以在低成本FPGA（Intel Cyclone或
Xilinx Spartan）。


\chapter{Components}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/components}
  \caption{A design consisting of a hierarchy of components.}
  \label{fig:components}
\end{figure}


A larger digital design is structured into a set of components, often in
a hierarchical way. Each component has an interface with input and output
wires, usually called ports. These are similar to input and output pins on an integrated circuit (IC).
Components are connected by wiring up the inputs and outputs.
Components may contain subcomponents to build the hierarchy.
The outermost component, which is connected to physical pins
on a chip, is called the top-level component.

一个大的数字设计是一系列组件部分构建而成的，经常是以层级的方式。
每个组件部分都有一个输入输出的接口，经常被称作端口。
这些和IC中的输入输出引脚类似。组成部分被输入和输出连接。
组件可能含有下属组件用来构建层级。最外层的组件，连接到芯片的物理引脚，称为上层组件。

Figure~\ref{fig:components} shows an example design. Component C has
three input ports and two output ports. The component itself is assembled out
of two subcomponents: B and C, which are connected to the inputs and
outputs of C. One output of A is connected to an input of B.
Component D is at the same hierarchy level as component C and connected
to it.

图4.1表明了一个示例设计。
C组件由两个输入端口和一个输出端口。
组件本身分为两个下属组件：A和B，连接到输入和C的输出。
A的一个输出连接到B的输入。
组件D和组件C有着相同层级，并且互相连接。


In this chapter, we will explain how components are described in Chisel and
provide several examples of standard components.
Those standard components serve two purposes: (1) they provide examples
of Chisel code and (2) they provide a library of components ready to be reused
in your design.

在本章节我们会解释组件在Chisel如何被描述，并提供一些标准组件的例子。
这些标准组件充当两个作用：1.他们提供Chisel代码的例子。
2. 他们提供组件库，为你的设计重新使用。

\section{Components in Chisel are Modules}

Hardware components are called modules in Chisel. Each module extends
the class \code{Module} and contains a field \code{io} for the interface.
The interface is defined by a \code{Bundle} that is wrapped into a call to \code{IO()}.

硬件组件在Chisel里称为module。每个module拓展了module类，并包含了一个界面的io域。

The \code{Bundle} contains fields to represent input and output ports of
the module. The direction is given by wrapping a field into either a call to \code{Input()}
or \code{Output()}. The direction is from the view of the component itself.

The following code shows the definition of the two example components A and B from
Figure~\ref{fig:components}:

\shortlist{code/components_ab.txt}

\noindent Component A has two inputs, named \code{a} and \code{b}, and two
outputs, named \code{x} and \code{y}. For the ports of component B
we chose the names \code{in1}, \code{in2}, and \code{out}.
All ports use an unsigned integer (\code{UInt}) with a bit width of 8.
As this example code is about connecting components and building a
hierarchy, we do not show any implementation within the components.
The implementation of the component is written at the place where
the comments states ``function of X''.
As we have no function associated with those example components,
we used generic port names. For a real design use descriptive
port names, such as \code{data}, \code{valid}, or \code{ready}.

Component C has three input and two output ports. It is built out of
components A and B. We show how A and B are connected to the ports
of C and also the connection between an output port of A and an
input port of B:

\shortlist{code/components_c.txt}

Components are created with \code{new}, e.g., \code{new CompA()}, and need to be wrapped
into a call to \code{Module()}. The reference to that module is stored in a local variable,
in this example \code{val compA = Module(new CompA())}.

With this reference, we can access the IO ports by dereferencing the \code{io} field of the module
and the individual fields of the IO \code{Bundle}.

The simplest component in our design has just an input port, named \code{in}, and
an output port named \code{out}.

\shortlist{code/components_d.txt}

The final missing piece of our example design is the top-level component, which itself
is assembled out of components C and D:

\shortlist{code/components_top.txt}

Good component design is similar to the good design of functions or methods in
software design. One of the main questions is how much functionality shall we put into
a component and how large should a component be. The two extremes are tiny
components, such an adder, and huge components, such as a full microprocessor,

良好的组件设计类似于以下功能或方法的良好设计：
软件设计。主要问题之一是我们应该投入多少功能
组件以及组件应多大。这两个极端很小
组件，例如加法器，以及庞大的组件，例如完整的微处理器，

Beginners in hardware design often start with tiny components.
The problem is that digital design books use tiny components to show the principles.
But the sizes of the examples (in those books, and also in this book) is small
to fit into a page and to not distract by too many details.

硬件设计的初学者通常从微型组件开始。
问题在于数字设计书使用微小的组件来显示原理。
但是示例的大小（在这些书以及本书中）都很小
以适合页面并且不会分散太多细节。

The interface to a component is a little bit verbose (with types, names, directions,
IO construction). As a rule of thumb, I would propose that the core of the component,
the function, should be at least as long as the interface of the component.


组件的界面有点冗长（包括类型，名称，方向，
IO建设）。根据经验，我建议组件的核心是
功能，应至少与组件的接口一样长。

For tiny components, such as a counter, Chisel provides a more lightweight
way to describe them as functions that return hardware.


对于细微的部件（例如计数器），Chisel提供了更轻巧的功能
将它们描述为返回硬件的函数的方式。


\section{An Arithmetic Logic Unit}

One of the central components for circuits that compute, e.g., a microprocessor, is an
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit}{arithmetic-logic unit},
or ALU for short. Figure~\ref{fig:alu} shows the symbol of an ALU.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/alu}
  \caption{An arithmetic logic unit, or ALU for short.}
  \label{fig:alu}
\end{figure}

The ALU has two data inputs, labeled \code{A} and \code{B} in the figure, one function input \code{fn},
and an output, labeled {Y}. The ALU operates on \code{A} and \code{B} and provides the result
at the output. The input \code{fn} selects the operation on \code{A} and \code{B}.
The operations are usually some arithmetic, such as addition and subtraction, and some logical
functions such as and, or, xor. That's why it is called ALU.

The function input \code{fn} selects the operation. The ALU is usually a combinational
circuit without any state elements. An ALU might also have additional outputs to signal properties
of the result, such as zero or the sign.

The following code shows an ALU with 16-bit inputs and outputs that supports: addition, subtraction, or, and and
operation, selected by a 2-bit \code{fn} signal.

\shortlist{code/components_alu.txt}

\noindent In this example, we use a new Chisel construct, the \code{switch/is} construct to describe
the table that selects the output of our ALU.
To use this utility function, we need to import another Chisel package:

\shortlist{code/components_util.txt}

\section{Bulk Connections}

For connecting components with multiple IO ports, Chisel provides the
bulk connection operator \code{<>}. This operator connects parts of bundles
in both directions. Chisel uses the names of the leave fields for the connection.
If a name is missing, it is not connected.

As an example, let us assume we build a pipelined processor. The fetch
stage has a following interface:
\shortlist{code/bundle_fetch.txt}

\noindent The next stage is the decode stage.
\shortlist{code/bundle_decode.txt}

\noindent The final stage of our simple processor is the execute stage.
\shortlist{code/bundle_execute.txt}

To connect all three stages we need just two \code{<>} operators.
We can also connect the port of a submodule with the parent module.
\shortlist{code/bundle_connect.txt}


\section{Lightweight Components with Functions}

Modules are the general way to structure your hardware description.
However, there is some boilerplate code when declaring a module and when instantiating and
connecting it.


模块是构造硬件描述的通用方法。
但是，在声明模块以及实例化和
连接它
将它们描述为返回硬件的函数的方式。

A lightweight way to structure your hardware is to use functions.
Scala functions can take Chisel (and Scala) parameters and return generated hardware.
As a simple example, we generate an adder:

构造硬件的轻型方法是使用功能。
Scala函数可以采用Chisel（和Scala）参数并返回生成的硬件。
作为一个简单的示例，我们生成一个加法器：

\shortlist{code/components_fn_def.txt}

\noindent We can then create two adders by simply calling the function \code{adder}.

\shortlist{code/components_fn_use.txt}

\noindent Note that this is a \emph{hardware generator}. You are not executing any add operation
during elaboration, but create two adders (hardware instances). The adder is an artificial example
to keep it simple. Chisel has already an adder generation function, like \code{+(that: UInt)}.

Functions as lightweight hardware generators can also contain state (including a register).
Following example returns a one clock cycle delay element (a register).
If a function has just a single statement, we can write it in one line and omit the curly
braces ({}).

\shortlist{code/components_fn_delay.txt}

\noindent By calling the function with the function itself as parameter, this generated a two
clock cycle delay.

\shortlist{code/components_fn_2delay.txt}

\noindent Again, this is a too short example to be useful, as \code{RegNext()}
already is that function creating the register for the delay.

Functions can be declared as part of a \code{Module}. However, functions that shall be
used in different modules are better placed into a Scala object that collects utility
functions.

可以将函数声明为Module的一部分。但是，应
最好将用于不同模块的模块放置在一个收集实用程序的Scala对象中
职能。

\chapter{Combinational Building Blocks}

In this chapter, we explore various combinational circuits, basic building blocks that we can
use to construct more complex systems.
In principle, all combinational circuits can be described with Boolean equations.
However, more often, a description in the form of a table is more efficient.
We let the synthesize tool extract and minimize the Boolean equations.
Two basic circuits, best described in a table form, are a decoder and an encoder.

在本章节，我们探索各种组合电路，基本的建造模块，我们可以用来构建更加复杂的系统·。
基本上所有的组合电路都能通过布尔算式被编写。
但是，更常见的情况，一个表格的描述是更为有效的。
我们让综合工具抓取并缩小布尔算式。
两个基本电路，最好是通过表格方式描述，一个是译码器，另一个是编码器。

\section{Combinational Circuits}

Before describing some standard combinational building blocks, we will explore
how combinational circuits can be expressed in Chisel.
The simplest form is a Boolean expression, which can be assigned a name:

在我们描述一些标准的组合建造模块，我们会探索组合电路如何在Chisel种被表示。
最简单的是布尔算式，这个可以通过给名字分配：

\shortlist{code/comb_bool.txt}

\noindent The Boolean expression is given a name (\code{e}) by assigning it
to a Scala value. The expression can be reused in other expressions:

布尔逻辑表达式通过给一个名字（a）一个Scala值。这个表达式可以在其它表达式重新使用：

\shortlist{code/comb_use.txt}

Such an expression is considered fixed. A reassignment to \code{e}
with \code{=} would result in a Scala compiler error: \code{reassignment to val}.
A try with the Chisel operator \code{:=}, as shown below,

这样的表达式被认为是固定的。
通过=给e命名会导致Scala编译器错误：reassignment to val。
尝试Chisel操作符:=, 像是如下，

\shortlist{code/comb_error.txt}

\noindent results in a runtime exception: \code{Cannot reassign to read-only}.

导致runtime例外：不能重新分配给只读。

Chisel also supports describing combinational circuits with conditional updates.
Such a circuit is declared as a \code{Wire}. Then you uses conditional operations,
such as \code{when}, to describe the logic of the circuit.
The following code declares a \code{Wire} \code{w} of type \code{UInt} and assigns a default
value of \code{0}. The \code{when} block takes a Chisel \code{Bool} and reassigns
\code{3} to \code{w} if \code{cond} is \code{true.B}.

Chisel也支持描述组合电路通过条件性更新。
这样的电路先被声明为一个Wire，然后使用条件操作，例如when，然后描述电路的逻辑。
接下来的代码表明了类型UInt的Wire，并把它分配给默认值0。
when部分接受一个Chisel的Bool，并重新分配给w，如果条件true.B。

\shortlist{code/comb_wire.txt}

\noindent The logic of the circuit is a multiplexer, where the two inputs are the constants
\code{0} and \code{3} and the condition \code{cond} the select signal.
Keep in mind that we describe hardware circuits and not a software program with conditional
execution.

电路的逻辑是一个复用器，这里两个输入是0和3， 然后条件cond是选择信号。
记住我们描述硬件电路，而不是使用软件程序中的条件执行。

The Chisel condition construct \code{when} also has a form of \emph{else}, it is called
\code{otherwise}. With assigning a value under any condition we can omit the default
value assignment:

Chisel条件建造when也有一个else的类型，它是otherwise。
在某些条件下通过给一个值分配，我们可以忽略默认值：

\shortlist{code/comb_otherwise.txt}

Chisel also supports a chain of conditionals (a if/elseif/else chain) with \code{.elsewhen}:

Chisel也支持一链条的条件（a if elseif else链条）通过.elsewhen

\shortlist{code/comb_elsewhen.txt}

Note the `.' in \code{.elsewhen} that is needed to chain methods in Scala.
Those \code{.elsewhen} branches can be arbitrary long.
However, if the chain of conditions depends on a single signal, it is better
to use the \code{switch} statement, which is introduced in the following
subsection with a decoder circuit.

记住.elsewhen中的"."在scala的链式方法是需要的。
这些“.elsewhen”分支可以是任意长的。
但是，如果条件链条取决于一个单个的信号，最好用switch声明，这个会在下边的译码器电路介绍。

For more complex combinational circuits it might be practical to assign
a default value to a \code{Wire}. A default assignment can be combined with the wire
declaration with \code{WireDefault}.\footnote{In the current version of Chisel
it is called WireInit, but will change to \code{WireDefault} with the release of Chisel 3.2}

对于更复杂的组合电路，可能设给Wire一个默认值更加有效。

\shortlist{code/comb_wiredefault.txt}

One might question why using \code{when}, \code{.elsewhen}, and \code{otherwise}
when Scala has \code{if}, \code{else if}, and \code{else}? Those statements are for
conditional execution of Scala code, not generating Chisel (multiplexer) hardware.
Those Scala conditionals have their use in Chisel when we write circuit generators,
which take parameters to conditionally generate \emph{different} hardware instances.

有人可能会问，为什么使用when，.elsewhen, 和.otherwise，Scala用的是if，else if和else。
这些声明式对于Scala代码的条件执行，不是用于生成Chisel（复用器）的硬件。
这些Scala条件分支在Chisel中写电路生成器的时候有用处，它会采取变量，并条件化生成不同的硬件部分。


\section{Decoder}

A \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decoder}{decoder}
converts a binary number of $n$ bits to an $m$-bit signal, where $m \leq 2^n$.
The output is one-hot encoded (where exactly one bit is one).


译码器把n位的二进制码转化位m位的信号，这里m小于等于2^n。
输出是独热码（这里1位对应的就是1）。

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/decoder}
  \caption{A 2-bit to 4-bit decoder.}
  \label{fig:decoder}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:decoder} shows a 2-bit to 4-bit decoder. We can describe the function
of the decoder with a truth table, such as Table~\ref{tab:decoder}.

图5.1表示了一个二位到四位的译码器，译码器的功能可以在真知表中被描述，像是表5.2。

\begin{table}
 \centering
 \label{tab:decoder}
  \begin{tabular}{rr}
    \toprule
    a & b \\
    \midrule
    00 & 0001 \\
    01 & 0010 \\
    10 & 0100 \\
    11 & 1000 \\
    \bottomrule 
  \end{tabular} 
  \caption{Truth table for a 2 to 4 decoder.}
\end{table}

A Chisel \code{switch} statement describes the logic as a truth table.
The \code{switch} statement is not part of the core Chisel language.
Therefore, we need to include the elements of the package \code{chisel.util}.

\shortlist{code/encdec_util.txt}

\noindent The following code introduces the \code{switch} statement of Chisel to describe a decoder:

下边的代码引用Chisel的switch声明去描述一个译码器：

\shortlist{code/encdec_dec.txt}

\noindent The above \code{switch} statement lists all possible values of the \code{sel} signal
and assigns the decoded value to the \code{result} signal.
Note that even if we enumerate all possible input values, Chisel still needs us to assign a
default value, as we do by assigning 0 to \code{result}.
This assignment will never be active and therefore optimized away by the backend tool.
It is intended to avoid situations with incomplete assignments for combinational circuits
(in Chisel a \code{Wire}) that will result in unintended latches in hardware description
languages such as VHDL and Verilog. Chisel does not allow incomplete assignments.

以上switch声明列出所有色sel信号的可能值，并把译码的值赋值到result信号。
注意，即使我们列举了所有可能的输入值，Chisel仍旧需要我们去赋值一个默认值，我们把result设为0。
这个赋值从来不会被激发，于是在后端工具被优化掉。
这个是用来防止组合电路的非完全赋值的情况（在Chisel是Wire），这样会导致硬件描述语言像是VHDL和Verilog的不想要的锁存器。
Chisel不允许非完全赋值。

In the example before we used unsigned integers for the signals. Maybe a clearer representation
of an encode circuit uses the binary notation:

在我们使用无符号整型的信号之前，一个可能更为清晰的编码器电路使用二进制表述：

\shortlist{code/encdec_decbin.txt}

\todo{from Luca: for very small examples. What if the one-hot input is 256 wires? Can Chisel capture that? Or I need 256 lines? I would suggest to put an additional example. Maybe there is something like the for loop in VHDL.}

A table gives a very readable representation of the decoder function but is also
a little bit verbose.
When examining the table, we see a regular structure: a 1 is shifted left by the number
represented by \code{sel}. Therefore, we can express a decoder with the Chisel shift
operation \code{<<}.

一个表格提供了更为刻度的译码器函数表示方式，但是这也变得拖沓。
当检查表格的时候，我们看到了一个常见的结构：1被向左移动了sel个单位。
于是，我们可以表达一个译码器通过Chisel移位操作<<。

\shortlist{code/encdec_shift.txt}

Decoders are used as a building block for a multiplexer by using the output as an enable
with an AND gate for the multiplexer data input. However, in Chisel, we do not need to construct
a multiplexer, as a \code{Mux} is available in the core library.
Decoders can also be used for address decoding, and then the outputs are used as
select signals, e.g., different IO devices connected to a microprocessor. 

译码器作为一个由复用器组成的部分，输出结果和使能，选用一个与门选择信号作为输入。
但是，在Chisel我们不需要搭建复用器，尽管库的Mux是可用的。
译码器可以用来翻译地址，然后输出是被选择的信号，例如，不同的IO器件连接到一个处理器。


\section{Encoder}

An \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoder_(digital)}{encoder}
converts a one-hot encoded input signal into a binary encoded output signal.
The encoder does the inverse operation of a decoder.

编码器把独热码输入信号转换为二进制编码形式作为输出。编码器是译码器的反向操作。

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/encoder}
  \caption{A 4-bit to 2-bit encoder.}
  \label{fig:encoder}
\end{figure}


\begin{table}
 \centering
 \label{tab:encoder}
  \begin{tabular}{rr}
    \toprule
    a & b \\
    \midrule
    0001 & 00 \\
    0010 & 01 \\
    0100 & 10 \\
    1000 & 11 \\
    ???? & ?? \\
    \bottomrule 
  \end{tabular} 
  \caption{Truth table for a 4 to 2 encoder.}
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:encoder} shows a 4-bit one-hot input to a 2-bit binary output encoder, and
Table~\ref{tab:encoder} shows the truth table of the encode function. However, an encoder
works only as expected when the input signal is one-hot coded. For all other input values, the output
is undefined. As we cannot describe a function with undefined outputs, we use a default
assignment that catches all undefined input patterns.

图5.2表明了一个4位独热码输入到一个二进制输出的编码器，表5.3是编码函数的真值表。
但是，编码器只在输入信号是独热码的时候工作。
对于其它的输入值，输出是未定义的。
所以我们不能描述一个有着未定义的函数作为输出，我们使用默认值赋值，抓取所有的未经定义的输入形式

The following Chisel code assigns a default value of 00 and then uses the switch statement
for the legal input values.

下边的Chisel代码赋值默认00，然后使用switch声明作为合法输入。

\shortlist{code/encdec_enc.txt}

\section{Exercise}

Describe a combinational circuit to convert a 4-bit binary input to the encoding of a
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display}{7-segment display}.

描述一个组合电路，用来转换4位二进制输入作为7位输出的编码。

You can either define the codes for the decimal digits, which was the initial
usage of a 7-segment display or additionally, define encodings for the remaining bit pattern
to be able to display all 16 values of a single digit in
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal}{hexadecimal}.
When you have an FPGA board with a 7-segment display, connect 4 switches or
buttons to the input of your circuit and the output to the 7-segment display.

\chapter{Sequential Building Blocks}

Sequential circuits are circuits where the output depends on the input \emph{and}
previous values. As we are interested in synchronous design (clocked designs),
we mean synchronous sequential circuits when we talk about sequential
circuits.\footnote{We can also build sequential circuits with asynchronous logic and
feedback, but this is a specific niche topic and cannot be expressed in Chisel.}
To build sequential circuits, we need elements that can store state:
the so-called registers.

时序电路的输出取决于输入和前一个值。
因为我们感兴趣的是同步设计（时钟设计），我们说时序电路，我们说的是同步时序电路。
为了搭建时序电路，我们需要储存状态的元素，所以我们称为寄存器。

\section{Registers}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/register}
  \caption{A D flip-flop based register.}
  \label{fig:register}
\end{figure}

The fundamental elements for building sequential circuits are registers. A register is a collection
of \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)\#D_flip-flop}{D flip-flops}.
A D flip-flop captures the value of its input at the rising edge of the clock and stores
it at its output. Alternatively, in other words: the register updates its output with the value of the input on the rising edge of the clock.

最基本的搭建时序电路的元素是寄存器。
寄存器是D触发器的集合。
D触发器在时钟上升沿抓取它的输入，并把它作为输出储存起来。
或者用另一句话，寄存器在时钟上升沿更新其输出，变为输入值。

Figure~\ref{fig:register} shows the schematic symbol of a register. It contains an input
\code{D} and an output \code{Q}. Each register also contains an input for a \code{clock} signal.
As this global clock signal is connected to all registers in a synchronous circuit, it is usually
not drawn in the schematic. The little triangle on the bottom of the box symbolizes the
clock input and tells us that this is a register.

图6.1表明寄存器的草图符号。
它包含输入D和输出Q。每个寄存器也包含了时钟信号作为输入。
在一个同步时序电路，作为全局时钟信号连接到所有寄存器，它一般在草图不画。
一个小的三角形在盒子的代表时钟输入，告诉我们这是一个寄存器。

We omit the clock signal in the following
drawings. The omission of the global clock signal is also reflected by Chisel where no explicit
connection of a signal to the register's clock input is needed.




In Chisel a register with input \code{d} and output \code{q} is defined with:

在Chisel一个寄存器d输入和q输出被被定义为：

\shortlist{code/sequ_reg.txt}

\noindent Note that we do not need to connect a clock to the register, Chisel implicitly does this.
A register's input and output can be arbitrary complex types
made out of a combination of vectors and bundles.

这里注明一下，我们不需要给寄存器连接时钟，这个在Chisel内部间接完成。 
寄存器的输入和输出可以是任何来自于vector和bundle组合的复杂类型。


A register can also be defined and used in two steps:

寄存器也可以被定义和两步使用：

\shortlist{code/sequ_reg2.txt}

First, we define the register and give it a name. Second, we connect the signal
\code{delayIn} to the input of the register. Note also that the name of the register
contains the string \code{Reg}. To easily distinguish between combinational
circuits and sequential circuits, it is common practice to have the marker
\code{Reg} as part of to the name. Also, note that names in Scala (and therefore
also in Chisel) are usually in
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case}{CamelCase}.
Variable names start with lowercase and classes start with upper case.

首先我们定义了寄存器并给它一个名字，其次我们连接了信号delayIn给寄存器的输入。
注意寄存器的名字是reg开始的。
为了简单区分组合电路和舒徐电路的元素，一般常用的方式是在开头添加reg的名字作为开头。
并且记得


A register can also be initialized on reset. The \code{reset} signal is, as the \code{clock} signal,
implicit in Chisel. We supply the reset value, e.g., zero, as a parameter to the register
constructor \code{RegInit}. The input for the register is connected with a Chisel
assignment statement.

一个寄存器也可以被复位初始化。复位信号是像时钟信号一样，在Chisel是显性的。我们提供了复位值，例如，零，
作为一个参数传给寄存器构造器RegInit。寄存器的输入是通过Chisel赋值声明连入的。

\shortlist{code/sequ_reg_init.txt}

The default implementation of reset in Chisel is a synchronous
reset.\footnote{Support for asynchronous reset is currently under development}
For a synchronous reset no change is needed on a D flip-flop, just a multiplexer
needs to be added to the input that selects between the initialization value under
reset and the data values.


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/register-reset}
  \caption{A D flip-flop based register with a synchronous reset.}
  \label{fig:register-reset}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:register-reset} shows the schematics of a register with a synchronous reset
where the reset drives the multiplexer. However, as synchronous reset is used quite often
modern FPGAs flip-flops contain a synchronous reset (and set) input to not wast LUT
resources for the multiplexer.

Sequential circuits change their value over time. Therefore, their behavior can be described
by a diagram showing the signals over time. Such a diagram is called a waveform or
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_timing_diagram}{timing diagram}.

\todo{from Luca: Do readers know about timing diagrams?}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/reg_wave}
  \caption{A waveform diagram for a register with a reset.}
  \label{fig:register-wave}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:register-wave} shows a waveform for the register with a reset
and some input data applied to it.
Time advances from left to right. On top of the figure, we see the clock that drives our circuit.
In the first clock cycle, before a reset, the register is undefined. In the second clock cycle reset
is asserted high, and on the rising edge of this clock cycle (labeled B) the register
captures the initial value of \code{0}. Input \code{inVal} is ignored. In the next clock cycle
\code{reset} is \code{0}, and the value of \code{inVal} is captured on the next rising
edge (labeled C). From then on \code{reset} stays \code{0}, as it should be, and the
register output follows the input signal with one clock cycle delay.

Waveforms are an excellent tool to specify the behavior of a circuit graphically.
Especially in more complex circuits where many operations happen in parallel
and data move pipelined through the circuit, timing diagrams are convenient.
Chisel testers can also produce waveforms during testing that can be displayed
with a waveform viewer and used for debugging.

职能。

A typical design pattern is a register with an enable signal. Only when the enable signal
is \code{true} (high), the register captures the input; otherwise, it keeps its old value.
The enable can be implemented, similar to the synchronous reset, with
a multiplexer at the input of the register. One input to the multiplexer is the feedback of the
output of the register.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/register-enable}
  \caption{A D flip-flop based register with an enable signal.}
  \label{fig:register-enable}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:register-enable} shows the schematics of a register with enable.
As this is also a common design pattern, modern FPGA flip-flops contain a
dedicated enable input, and no additional resources are needed.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/reg_en_wave}
  \caption{A waveform diagram for a register with an enable signal.}
  \label{fig:register-en-wave}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:register-en-wave} shows an example waveform for a register
with enable. Most of the time, enable it high (\code{true}) and the register
follows the input with one clock cycle delay. Only in the fourth clock cycle
\code{enable} is low, and the register keeps its value (5) at rising edge D.

A register with an enable can be described in a few lines of Chisel code
with a conditional update:

\shortlist{code/sequ_reg_ena.txt}

\noindent A register with enable can also be reset:

\shortlist{code/sequ_reg_init_ena.txt}

A register can also be part of an expression. Following circuit detects the rising edge
of a signal by comparing its current value with the one from the last clock cycle.

\shortlist{code/sequ_reg_rising.txt}

Now that we have explored all basic uses of a register, we put those registers to
good use and build more interesting sequential circuits.


现在，我们已经探索了寄存器的所有基本用途，我们将这些寄存器放入
善用并构建更有趣的时序电路。

\section{Counters}
\label{sec:counter}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/counter}
  \caption{An adder and a register result in counter.}
  \label{fig:counter}
\end{figure}

One of the most basic sequential circuits is a counter. In its simplest form, a counter is a register
where the output is connected to an adder and the adder's output is connected to the input
of the register. Figure~\ref{fig:counter} shows such a free-running counter.

计数器是最基本的时序电路之一。以最简单的形式，计数器就是寄存器
输出连接到加法器，而加法器的输出连接到输入
寄存器。图counter显示了这样一个自由运行的计数器。

A free-running counter with a 4-bit register counts from 0 to 15 and then wraps around
to 0 again. A counter shall also be reset to a known value.

具有4位寄存器的自由运行计数器从0到15计数，然后回绕
再次设为0。计数器也应重置为已知值。

\shortlist{code/sequ_free_counter.txt}

\noindent When we want to count events, we use a condition to  increment the counter.

\shortlist{code/sequ_event_counter.txt}

\subsection{Counting Up and Down}

To count up to a value and then restart with \code{0}, we need to compare
the counter value with a maximum constant, e.g., with a \code{when}
conditional statement.

要计算一个值，然后使用\code{0}重新启动，我们需要比较
具有最大常数的计数器值，例如带有\code{when}
有条件的声明。

\shortlist{code/when_counter.txt}

\noindent We can also use a multiplexer for our counter:

\shortlist{code/mux_counter.txt}

\noindent If we are in the mood of counting down, we start (reset the counter register)
with the maximum value and reset the counter to that value when reaching 0.


如果我们有倒数的想法，我们开始（重置计数器寄存器）
设置为最大值，并在达到0时将计数器重置为该值。

\shortlist{code/down_counter.txt}

\noindent As we are writing and using more counters, we can
define a function with a parameter to generate a counter for us.

\shortlist{code/function_counter.txt}

\noindent The last statement of the function \code{genCounter} is the return
value of the function, in this example, the counting register \code{cntReg}.

Note, that in all the examples our counter had values between \code{0} and
\code{N}, including \code{N}. If we want to count 10 clock cycles we need
to set \code{N} to 9. Setting \code{N} to 10 would be a classic example of an
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error}{off-by-one error}.

\subsection{Generating Timing with Counters}

Besides counting events, counters are often used to generate timing.
A synchronous circuit runs with a clock with a fixed frequency.
The circuit proceeds in those clock ticks. There is no notion of time in a digital
circuit other than counting clock ticks. If we know the clock frequency, we
can generate circuits that generate timed events, such as blinking a LED
at some frequency as we have shown in the Chisel ``Hello World'' example.

A common practice is to generate single-cycle \emph{ticks} with a frequency $f_{tick}$
that we need in our circuit. That tick occurs every $n$ clock cycles,
where $n = f_{clock}/f_{tick}$ and the tick is precisely one clock cycle long.
This tick is \emph{not} used as a derived clock, but as an enable signal for
registers in the circuit that shall logically operate at frequency $f_{tick}$.
Figure~\ref{fig:tick-wave} shows an example of a tick generated every
3 clock cycles.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/tick_wave}
  \caption{A waveform diagram for the generation of a slow frequency tick.}
  \label{fig:tick-wave}
\end{figure}


In the following circuit, we describe a counter that counts from \code{0}
to the maximum value of \code{N - 1}. When the maximum value is reached,
the \code{tick} is \code{true} for a single cycle, and the counter is reset to \code{0}.
When we count from \code{0} to \code{N - 1}, we generate one logical tick
every \code{N} clock cycles.

\shortlist{code/sequ_tick_gen.txt}

\noindent This logical timing of one tick every $n$ clock cycles can then be used
to advance other parts of our circuit with this slower, logical clock.
In the following code, we use just another counter that increments by \code{1}
every $n$ clock cycles.

\shortlist{code/sequ_tick_counter.txt}

Examples of the usage of this slower \emph{logical} clock are: blinking an LED,
generating the baud rate for a serial bus, generating signals for 7-segment
display multiplexing, and subsampling input values for debouncing of buttons
and switches. 

Although width inference should size the registers, it is better to explicitly
specify the width with the type at register definition or with the
initialization value. Explicit width definition can avoid surprises when a reset value of \code{0.U}
results in a counter with a width of a single bit.

\subsection{The Nerd Counter}

Many of us feel like being a \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd}{nerd}, sometimes.
For example, we want to design a highly optimized version of our counter/tick generation.
A standard counter needs following resources: one register, one adder (or subtractor),
and a comparator. We cannot do much about the register or the adder. If we count
up, we need to compare against a number, which is a bit string. The comparator
can be built out of inverters for the zeros in the bit string and a large AND gate.
When counting down to zero, the comparator is a large NOR gate, which might be
a little bit cheaper than the comparator against a constant in an ASIC.
In an FPGA, where logic is built out of lookup tables, there is no difference between comparing
against a 0 or 1 bit. The resource requirement is the same for the up and down counter.

However, there is still one more trick a clever hardware designer can pull off.
Counting up or down needed a comparison against all counting bits, so far.
What if we count from N-2 down to -1? A negative number has the most significant bit
set to 1, and a positive number has this bit set to 0. We need to check this bit only to detect
that our counter reached -1. Here it is, the counter created by a nerd:

但是，这里仍然有一个小窍门，硬件设计者可以借鉴。
目前向上数或向下数需要与所有的计数位比较。
当你向下数太多会发生什么？
那种情况，计数变为负数。探测一个负数只是简单比较最高位“a”就好。

\shortlist{code/nerd_counter.txt}

\section{Memory}

A memory can be built out of a collection of registers, in Chisel a \code{Reg} of a \code{Vec}.
However, this is expensive in hardware, and larger memory structures are built
as \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory}{SRAM}.
For an ASIC, a memory compiler constructs memories.
FPGAs contain on-chip memory blocks, also called block RAMs.
Those on-chip memory blocks can be combined for larger memories.
Memories in an FPGA usually have one read and one write port, or
two ports where the direction can be switched.

FPGAs (and also ASICs) usually support synchronous memories.
Synchronous memories have registers on their inputs (read and write address, write data,
and write enable). That means the read data is available one clock
cycle after setting the address.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/memory}
  \caption{A synchronous memory.}
  \label{fig:memory}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:memory} shows the schematics of such a synchronous memory.
The memory is dual-ported with one read port and one write port.
The read port has a single input, the read address (\code{rdAddr}) and
one output, the read data (\code{rdData}).
The write port has three inputs: the address (\code{wrAddr}), the data
to be written (\code{wrData}), and a write enable (\code{wrEna}).
Note that for all inputs, there is a register within the memory showing the
synchronous behavior.

To support on-chip memory, Chisel provides the memory constructor \code{SyncReadMem}.
Listing~\ref{lst:memory} shows a component \code{Memory} that implements
1~KB of memory with byte-wide input and output data and a write enable.

\longlist{code/memory.txt}{1 KB of synchronous memory.}{lst:memory}

An interesting question is which value is returned from a read when in the same clock
cycle a new value is written the same address that is read out.
We are interested in the read-during-write behavior of the memory.
There are three possibilities: the newly written value, the old value, or undefined
(which might be a mix of some bits from the old value and some of the newly written data).
Which possibility is available in an FPGA depends on the FPGA type and
sometimes can be specified.

一个有趣的问题是，在同一时钟中，从读取返回哪个值
循环将一个新值写入与读出相同的地址。
我们对内存的read-during-write行为感兴趣。
有三种可能：新写入的值，旧值或未定义
（这可能是旧值中的一些位与一些新写入的数据的混合）。
FPGA中可用的可能性取决于FPGA类型和
有时可以指定。

Chisel documents that the read data is undefined.

Chisel档案中读取数据是未定义的。

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/memory-forwarding}
  \caption{A synchronous memory with forwarding for a defined read-during-write behavior.}
  \label{fig:memory:forwarding}
\end{figure}

If we want to read out the newly written value, we can build a forwarding
circuit that detects that the addresses are equal and \emph{forwards} the
write data. Figure~\ref{fig:memory:forwarding} shows the memory with
the forwarding circuit. Read and write addresses are compared and gated with
the write enable to select between the forwarding path of the write data or the
memory read data. The write data is delayed by one clock cycle with a register.

Listing~\ref{lst:memory:forward} shows the Chisel code for a synchronous memory
including the forwarding circuit. We need to store the write data into a register
(\code{wrDataReg}) to be available in the next clock cycle the synchronous
memory also has a one clock cycle latency.
We compare the two input addresses (\code{wrAddr} and \code{rdAddr})
and check if \code{wrEna} is true for the forwarding condition.
That condition is also delayed by one clock cycle.
A multiplexer selects between the forwarding (write) data or the read
data from memory.

\longlist{code/memory_forwarding.txt}{A memory with a forwarding circuit.}{lst:memory:forward}



Chisel also provides \code{Mem}, which represents a memory with synchronous
write and an asynchronous read. As this memory type is usually not directly available
in an FPGA, the synthesize tool will build it out of flip-flops.
Therefore, we recommend using \code{SyncReadMem}.


\section{Exercise}

Use the 7-segment encoder from the last exercise and add a 4-bit counter as input
to switch the display from \code{0} to \code{F}. When you directly connect this
counter to the clock of the FPGA board, you will see all 16 numbers
overlapped (all 7 segments will light up).
Therefore, you need to slow down the counting. Create a second
counter that can generate a single-cycle \emph{tick} signal every 500 milliseconds.
Use that signal as enable signal for the 4-bit counter.

\todo{Luca: More exercises would be nice. Maybe in the future?}

\chapter{Finite-State Machines}

A finite-state machine (FSM) is a basic building block in digital design.
An FSM can be described as a set of \emph{states} and conditional (guarded)
\emph{state transitions} between states. 
An FSM has an initial state, which is set on reset.
FSMs are also called synchronous sequential circuits.

An implementation of an FSM consists of three parts: (1) a register that holds the current state,
(2) combinational logic that computes the next state that depends on the current
state and the input, and (3) combinational logic that computes the output of the FSM.

In principle, every digital circuit that contains a register or other memory elements
to store state can be described as a single FSM. However, this might
not be practical, e.g., try to describe your laptop as a single FSM.
In the next chapter, we describe how to build larger systems
out of smaller FSMs by combining them into communicating FSMs.

\section{Basic Finite-State Machine}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/fsm}
  \caption{A finite state machine (Moore type).}
  \label{fig:fsm}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:fsm} shows the schematics of an FSM. The register contains the current \code{state}.
The next state logic computes the next state value (\code{next\_state})
from the current \code{state} and the input (\code{in}).
On the next clock tick, \code{state} becomes \code{next\_state}.
The output logic computes the output (\code{out}). As the output depends on the current
state only, this state machine is called a
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_machine}{Moore machine}.

A \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram}{state diagram}
describes the behavior of such an FSM visually.
In a state diagram, individual states are depicted as circles labeled
with the state names.
State transitions are shown with arrows between states.
The guard (or condition) when this transition is taken is drawn as a label
for the arrow.

Figure~\ref{fig:diag-moore} shows the state diagram of a simple example FSM.
The FSM has three states: \emph{green}, \emph{orange}, and \emph{red},
indicating a level of alarm. The FSM starts at the \emph{green} level.
When a \emph{bad event} happens the alarm level is switched to \emph{orange}.
On a second bad event, the alarm level is switched to \emph{red}.
In that case, we want to ring a bell; \emph{ring bell} it the only output of this FSM.
We add the output to the \emph{red} state.
The alarm can be reset with a \emph{clear} signal.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/state-diag-moore}
  \caption{The state diagram of an alarm FSM.}
  \label{fig:diag-moore}
\end{figure}

Although a state diagram may be visually pleasing and the function of an FSM
can be grasped quickly, a state table may be quicker to write down.
Table~\ref{tab:state:table} shows the state table for our alarm FSM.
We list the current state, the input values, the resulting next state, and
the output value for the current state. In principle, we would need to
specify all possible inputs for all possible states. This table would have
$3 \times 4 = 12$ rows. We simplify the table by indicating that the \emph{clear}
input is a don't care when a \emph{bad event} happens. That means
\emph{bad event} has priority over \emph{clear}. The output column
has some repetition. If we have a larger FSM and/or more outputs, we
can split the table into two, one for the next state logic and one for the
output logic.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{State table for the alarm FSM.}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
\toprule
& \multicolumn{2}{c}{Input} \\
\cmidrule{2-3}
State &  Bad event & Clear & Next state & Ring bell \\
\midrule
green & 0 & 0 & green & 0 \\
green & 1 & - & orange & 0 \\
orange & 0 & 0 & orange & 0 \\
orange & 1 & - & red & 0 \\
orange & 0 & 1 & green & 0 \\
red & 0 & 0 & red & 1 \\
red & 0 & 1 & green & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:state:table}
\end{table}

Finally, after all the design of our warning level FSM, we shall code it in Chisel.
Listing~\ref{lst:fsm:alarm} shows the Chisel code for the alarm FSM.
Note, that we use the Chisel type \code{Bool} for the inputs and the
output of the FSM.
To use \code{Enum} and the \code{switch} control instruction, we need to
import \code{chisel3.util.\_}.

\longlist{code/simple_fsm.txt}{The Chisel code for the alarm FSM.}{lst:fsm:alarm}

The complete Chisel code for this simple FSM fits into one page.
Let us step through the individual parts.
The FSM has two input and a single output signal, captured in a Chisel \code{Bundle}:
%
\shortlist{code/simple_fsm_io.txt}


\noindent Quite some work has been spent in optimal state encoding. Two common options
are binary or one-hot encoding. However, we leave those low-level decisions to
the synthesize tool and aim for readable code.\footnote{In the current version
of Chisel the \code{Enum} type represents states in binary encoding.
If we want a different encoding, e.g., one-hot encoding, we can define Chisel
constants for the state names.}
Therefore, we use an enumeration type with symbolic names for the states:

\shortlist{code/simple_fsm_states.txt}

\noindent The individual state values are described as a list where the individual
elements are concatenated with the \code{::} operator; \code{Nil} represents
the end of the list. An \code{Enum} instance is \emph{assigned} to the list of states.
The register holding the state is defined with the \emph{green} state as the reset value:



\shortlist{code/simple_fsm_register.txt}

\noindent The meat of the FSM is in the next state logic. We use a Chisel switch on the
state register to cover all states. Within each \code{is} branch we code the next state
logic, which depends on the inputs, by assigning a new value for our state register:

\shortlist{code/simple_fsm_next.txt}

\noindent Last, but not least, we code our \emph{ringing bell} output to be true when
the state is \emph{red}.

\shortlist{code/simple_fsm_output.txt}

Note that we did \emph{not} introduce a \code{next\_state} signal for the register input,
as it is common practice in Verilog or VHDL.
Registers in Verilog and VHDL are described in a special syntax and cannot
be assigned (and reassigned) within a combinational block.
Therefore, the additional signal, computed in a combinational block, is
introduced and connected to the register input.
In Chisel a register is a base type and can be freely used within a combinational block.

\section{Faster Output with a Mealy FSM}

On a Moore FSM, the output depends only on the current state.
That means that a change of an input can be seen as a change of the
output \emph{earliest} in the next clock cycle.
If we want to observe an immediate change, we need a combinational
path from the input to the output.
Let us consider a minimal example, an edge detection circuit.
We have seen this Chisel one-liner before:

\shortlist{code/sequ_reg_rising.txt}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/fsm-rising}
  \caption{A rising edge detector (Mealy type FSM).}
  \label{fig:fsm-rising}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:fsm-rising} shows the schematic of the rising edge detector.
The output becomes 1 for one clock cycle when the current input is 1
and the input in the last clock cycle was 0.
The state register is just a single D flip-flop where the next state
is just the input. We can also consider this as a delay element of one
clock cycle. The output logic \emph{compares} the current
input with the current state.



When the output depends also on the input, i.e., there is a combinational path between
the input of the FSM and the output, this is called a
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine}{Mealy machine}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/mealy}
  \caption{A Mealy type finite state machine.}
  \label{fig:mealy}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:mealy} shows the schematic of a Mealy type FSM.
Similar to the Moore FSM, the register contains the current \code{state}, and
the next state logic computes the next state value (\code{next\_state})
from the current \code{state} and the input (\code{in}).
On the next clock tick, \code{state} becomes \code{next\_state}.
The output logic computes the output (\code{out}) from the current state
\emph{and} the input to the FSM.


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/state-diag-mealy}
  \caption{The state diagram of the rising edge detector as Mealy FSM.}
  \label{fig:diag:mealy}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:diag:mealy} shows the state diagram of the Mealy FSM for the
edge detector. As the state register consists just of a single D flip-flop,
only two states are possible, which we name \code{zero} and \code{one} in this
example.
As the output of a Mealy FSM does not only depend on the state, but also
on the input, we cannot describe the output as part of the state circle.
Instead, the transitions between the states are labeled with the input
value (condition) \emph{and} the output (after the slash).
Note also that we draw self transitions, e.g., in state \code{zero} when
the input is \code{0} the FSM stays in state \code{zero}, and the output is {0}.
The rising edge FSM generates the \code{1} output only on the transition
from state \code{zero} to state \code{one}. In state \code{one}, which represents
that the input is now \code{1}, the output is \code{0}. We only want a single (cycle)
puls for each rising edge of the input.

\longlist{code/rising_fsm.txt}{Rising edge detection with a Mealy FSM.}{lst:fsm:rising}

Listing~\ref{lst:fsm:rising} shows the Chisel code for the rising edge detection
with a Mealy machine.
As in the previous example, we use the Chisel type \code{Bool} for the
single-bit input and output.
The output logic is now part of the next state logic; on the transition from
\code{zero} to \code{one}, the output is set to \code{true.B}. Otherwise,
the default assignment to the output (\code{false.B}) counts.

One can ask if a full-blown FSM is the best solution for the edge detection circuit,
especially, as we have seen a Chisel one-liner for the same functionality.
The hardware consumptions is similar. Both solutions need a single D flip-flop
for the state. The combinational logic for the FSM is probably a bit more complicated, as
the state change depends on the current state and the input value.
For this function, the one-liner is easier to write and easier to read,
which is more important. Therefore, the one-liner is the preferred solution.

We have used this example to show one of the smallest possible Mealy FSMs.
FSMs shall be used for more complex circuits with three and more states.

\section{Moore versus Mealy}

To show the difference between a Moore and Mealy FSM, we redo the edge
detection with a Moore FSM. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/state-diag-rising-moore}
  \caption{The state diagram of the rising edge detector as Moore FSM.}
  \label{fig:diag:rising:moore}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:diag:rising:moore} shows the state diagram for the rising
edge detection with a Moore FSM. The first thing to notice is that the Moore FSM
needs three states, compared to two states in the Mealy version.
The state \code{puls} is needed to produce the single-cycle puls.
The FSM stays in state \code{puls} just one clock cycle and then
proceeds either back to the start state \code{zero} or to the \code{one}
state, waiting for the input to become 0 again.
We show the input condition on the state transition arrows and the
FSM output within the state representing circles.

\longlist{code/rising_moore_fsm.txt}{Rising edge detection with a Moore FSM.}{lst:fsm:rising:moore}

Listing~\ref{lst:fsm:rising:moore} shows the Moore version of the rising edge detection
circuit. Is uses double the number of D flip-flops than the Mealy or direct
coded version. The resulting next state logic is therefore also larger
than the Mealy or direct coded version.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/rising}
  \caption{Mealy and a  Moore FSM waveform for rising edge detection.}
  \label{fig:rising}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:rising} shows the waveform of a Mealy and a  Moore version
of the rising edge detection FSM. We can see that the Mealy output closely
follows the input rising edge, while the Moore output rises after the clock tick.
We can also see that the Moore output is one clock cycle wide, where the Mealy
output is usually less than a clock cycle.

From the above example, one is tempted to find Mealy FSMs the \emph{better}
FSMs as they need less state (and therefore logic) and react faster than a Moore FSM.
However, the combinational path within a Mealy machine can cause trouble in
larger designs. First, with a chain of communicating FSM (see next chapter), this
combinational path can become lengthy. Second, if the communicating FSMs build
a circle, the result is a combinational loop, which is an error in synchronous design.
Due to a cut in the combinational path with the state register in a Moore FSM,
all the above issues do not exist for communicating Moore FSMs.

In summary, Moore FSMs combine better for communicating state machines; they
are \emph{more robust} than Mealy FSMs. Use Mealy FSMs only when the reaction within the same
cycle is of utmost importance. Small circuits such as the rising edge detection,
which are practically Mealy machines, are fine as well.

\section{Exercise}

% This is a boring example, maybe I can find something more interesting
In this chapter, you have seen many examples of very small FSMs.
Now it is time to write some \emph{real} FSM code.
Pick a little bit more complex example and implement the FSM and
write a test bench for it.

A classic example for a FSM is a traffic light controller (see~\cite[Section~14.3]{dally:vhdl:2016}).
A traffic light controller has to ensure that on a switch from red to green
there is a phase in between where both roads in the intersection
have a no-go light (red and orange).
To make this example a little bit more interesting, consider a priority road.
The minor road has two car detectors (on both entries into the intersection).
Switch to green for the minor road only when a car is detected and then switch
back to green for the priority road.

\todo{Luca: Greatest common divisor with Euclide algorithm can be also a nice exercise.
Martin: but this is shown at the Chisel homepage without an FSM.}

\chapter{Communicating State Machines}

A problem is often too complex to describe it with a single FSM.
In that case, the problem can be divided into two or more smaller and simpler FSMs.
Those FSMs then communicate with signals. One FSMs output is
another FSMs input, and the FSM watches the output of the other FSM.
When we split a large FSM into simpler ones, this is called factoring FSMs.
However, often communicating FSMs are directly designed from the specification,
as often a single FSM would be infeasible large.

\section{A Light Flasher Example}

To discuss communicating FSMs, we use an example
from~\cite[Chapter~17]{dally:vhdl:2016}, the light flasher.
The light flasher has one input \code{start} and one output
\code{light}. The specification of the light flasher is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item when \code{start} is high for one clock cycle, the flashing
sequence starts;
\item the sequence is to flash three times;
\item where the \code{light} goes \emph{on} for six clock cycles, and the \code{light} goes \emph{off} for four clock cycles between flashes;
\item after the sequence, the FSM switches the \code{light} \emph{off} and waits
for the next start.
\end{itemize}

The FSM for a direct implementation\footnote{The state diagram is shown
in~\cite[p.~376]{dally:vhdl:2016}.} has 27 states:
one initial state that is waiting for the input, $3 \times 6$ states for the three
\emph{on} states and $2 \times 4$ states for the \emph{off} states.
We do not show the code for this simple-minded implementation of the light
flasher.

The problem can be solved more elegantly by factoring this large FSM into
two smaller FSMs: the master FSM implements the flashing logic, and the timer FSM
implements the waiting. Figure~\ref{fig:flasher} shows the composition of
the two FSMs.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/flasher}
  \caption{The light flasher split into a Master FSM and a Timer FSM.}
  \label{fig:flasher}
\end{figure}

The timer FSM counts down for 6 or 4 clock cycles to produce the desired timing.
The timer specification is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item when \code{timerLoad} is asserted, the timer loads a value into the down counter,
independent of the state;
\item \code{timerSelect} selects between 5 or 3 for the load;
\item \code{timerDone} is asserted when the counter completed the countdown
and remains asserted;
\item otherwise, the timer counts down.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Following code shows the timer FSM of the light flasher:

\shortlist{code/flasher_timer.txt}

\noindent Listing~\ref{lst:flasher:master} shows the master FSM.

\longlist{code/flasher_fsm.txt}{Master FSM of the light flasher.}{lst:flasher:master}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/flasher2}
  \caption{The light flasher split into a Master FSM, a Timer FSM, and a Counter FSM.}
  \label{fig:flasher2}
\end{figure}

This solution with a master FSM and a timer has still redundancy in the code
of the master FSM. States \code{flash1}, \code{flash2}, and \code{flash3}
are performing the same function, states \code{space1} and \code{space2} as well.
We can factor out the number of remaining flashes into a second counter.
Then the master FSM is reduced to three states: \code{off}, \code{flash},
and \code{space}.

Figure~\ref{fig:flasher2} shows the design with a master FSM and two FSMs
that count: one FSM to count clock cycles for the interval length of \emph{on}
and \emph{off}; the second FSM to count the remaining flashes.

Following code shows the down counter FSM:

\shortlist{code/flasher2_counter.txt}

\noindent Note, that the counter is loaded with 2 for 3 flashes, as it counts the
\emph{remaining} flashes and is decremented in state \code{space} when the timer
is done. Listing~\ref{lst:flasher2:master} shows the master FSM for the double refactored flasher.

\longlist{code/flasher2_fsm.txt}{Master FSM of the double refactored light flasher.}{lst:flasher2:master}

Besides having a master FSM that is reduced to just three states, our current solution
is also better configurable. No FSM needs to be changed if we want to change
the length of the \emph{on} or \emph{off} intervals or the number of flashes.

In this section, we have explored communicating circuits, especially FSM, that
only exchange control signals. However, circuits can also exchange data.
For the coordinated exchange of data, we use handshake signals.
The next section describes the ready-valid interface for flow control of
unidirectional data exchange.

\section{State Machine with Datapath}

One typical example of communicating state machines is a state machine
combined with a datapath. This combination is often called a finite state machine
with datapath (FSMD). The state machine controls the datapath, and the datapath
performs the computation. The FSM input is the input from the environment and the input
from the datapath. The data from the environment is fed into the datapath, and the
data output comes from the datapath. Figure~\ref{fig:popcnt-fsmd} shows an example
of the combination of the FSM with the datapath.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/popcnt-fsmd}
  \caption{A state machine with a datapath.}
  \label{fig:popcnt-fsmd}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Popcount Example}

The FSMD shown in Figure~\ref{fig:popcnt-fsmd} serves as an example that computes the
popcount, also called the \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight}{Hamming weight}.
The Hamming weight is the number of symbols different from the zero symbol.
For a binary string, this is the number of `1's.

The popcount unit contains the data input \code{din} and the result output \code{popCount},
both connected to the datapath. For the input and the output we use a ready-valid handshake.
When data is available, valid is asserted. When a receiver can accept data it asserts ready.
When both signals are asserted the transfer takes place. The handshake signals are connected
to the FSM. The FSM is connected with the datapath with control signals towards the datapath
and with status signals from the datapath.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/popcnt-states}
  \caption{State diagram for the popcount FSM.}
  \label{fig:popcnt-states}
\end{figure}

As a next step, we can design the FSM, starting with a state diagram, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:popcnt-states}. We start in state \code{Idle}, where the FSM waits
for input. When data arrives, signaled with a valid signal, the FSM advances to state \code{Load}
to load a shift register. The FSM proceeds to the next state \code{Count}, there the number
of `1's is counted sequentially. We use a shift register, an adder, an accumulator
register, and a down counter to perform the computation. When the down counter reaches
zero, we are finished and the FSM moves to state \code{Done}. There the FSM signals with a valid
signal that the popcount value is ready to be consumed. On a ready signal from the
receiver, the FSM moves back to the \code{Idle} state, ready to compute the next popcount.

The top level component, shown in Listing~\ref{lst:pop:top} instantiates the FSM and the datapath components and connects
them with bulk connections.

\longlist{code/popcnt_main.txt}{The top level of the popcount circuit.
\todo{Bulk connection should be used here (and tested).}}{lst:pop:top}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/popcnt-data}
  \caption{Datapath for the popcount circuit.}
  \label{fig:popcnt-data}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:popcnt-data} shows the datapath for the popcount circuit.
The data is loaded into the \code{shf} register. On the load also the \code{cnt}
register is reset to 0. To count the number of `1's, the \code{shf} register is shifted
right, and the least significant bit is added to \code{cnt} each clock cycle.
A counter, not shown in the figure, counts down until all bits have been shifted
through the least significant bit. When the counter reaches zero, the popcount
has finished. The FSM switches to state \code{Done} and signals the result
by asserting \code{popCntReady}. When the result is read, signaled by asserting
\code{popCntValid} the FSW switches back to \code{Idle}.

On a \code{load} signal, the \code{regData} register is loaded with the input,
the \code{regPopCount} register reset to 0, and the counter register \code{regCount}
set to the number of shifts to be performed.

Otherwise, the \code{regData} register is shifted to the right, the least significant bit
of the \code{regData} register added to the \code{regPopCount} register, and the counter
decremented until it is 0. When the counter is 0, the output contains the popcount.
Listing~\ref{lst:pop:data} shows the Chisel code for the datapath of the popcount
circuit.

\longlist{code/popcnt_data.txt}{Datapath of the popcount circuit.}{lst:pop:data}

The FSM starts in state \code{idle}. On a valid signal for the input data (\code{dinValid}) it
switches to the \code{count} state and waits till the datapath has finished counting.
When the popcount is valid, the FSM switches to state \code{done} and waits till the
popcount is read (signaled by \code{popCntReady}).
Listing~\ref{lst:pop:fsm} shows the code of the FSM.

\longlist{code/popcnt_fsm.txt}{The FSM of the popcount circuit.}{lst:pop:fsm}

\section{Ready-Valid Interface}

\todo{Luca: This comes very sudden after all this FSM reading.
Maybe give some more context and a timing diagram.}

Communication of subsystems can be generalized to the movement
of data and handshaking for flow control. In the popcount example,
we have seen a handshaking interface for the input and the output data
using valid and ready signals.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/readyvalid}
  \caption{The ready-valid flow control.}
  \label{fig:readyvalid}
\end{figure}

The ready-valid interface~\cite[p.~480]{dally:vhdl:2016} is a simple flow
control interface consisting of \code{data} and a \code{valid} signal at the
sender side and a \code{ready} signal at the receiver side (see
Figure~\ref{fig:readyvalid}). The sender asserts \code{valid} when \code{data} is available,
and the receiver asserts \code{ready} when it is ready to receive one word
of data. The transmission of the data happens when both signals, \code{valid}
and \code{ready}, are asserted. If either of the two signals is not asserted,
no transfer takes place.

To make this interface composable neither \code{ready} not \code{valid} is
allowed to depend combinational on the other signal.

\todo{Read and cite AXI}

\chapter{Hardware Generators}

The strength of Chisel is that it allows us to write so-called hardware generators.
With older hardware description languages, such as VHDL and Verilog,
we usually use another language, e.g., Java or Python, to generate hardware.
The author has often written small Java programs to generate VHDL tables.
In Chisel, the full power of Scala (and Java libraries) is available at hardware
construction. Therefore, we can write our hardware generators in the same
language and execute them as part of the Chisel circuit generation.

\section{Configure with Parameters}

Chisel components and functions can be configured with parameters.
Parameters can be as simple as an integer constant, but can also be a Chisel
hardware type.

\subsection{Simple Parameters}

The basic way to parameterize a circuit is to define a bit width as a parameter.
Parameters can be passed as arguments to
the constructor of the Chisel module. Following example is a toy example of
a module that implements an adder with a configurable bit width.
The bit width \code{n} is a parameter (of Scala type \code{Int}) of the component
passed into the constructor that can be used in the IO bundle.

\shortlist{code/param_adder.txt}

\noindent Parameterized versions of the adder can be created as follows:

\shortlist{code/use_param_adder.txt}

\subsection{Functions with Type Parameters}

Having the bit width as a configuration parameter is just the starting point for
hardware generators. A very flexible configuration is the usage of types.
That feature allows for Chisel to provide a multiplexer (\code{Mux}) that
can accept any types for the multiplexing.
To show how to use types for the configuration, we build a multiplexer
that accepts arbitrary types. Following function defines the multiplexer:

\shortlist{code/param_func.txt}

Chisel allows parameterizing functions with types, in our case with Chisel
types. The expression in the square brackets \code{[T <: Data]} defines
a type parameter \code{T} set is \code{Data} or a subclass of \code{Data}.
\code{Data} is the root of the Chisel type system.

Our multiplexer function has three parameters: the boolean condition,
one parameter for the true path, and one parameter for the false path.
Both path parameters are of type \code{T}, an information that is
provided at function call. The function itself is straight forward:
we define a wire with the default value of \code{fPath} and
change the value is the condition is true to the \code{tPath}.
This condition is a classic multiplexer function.
At the end of the function, we return the multiplexer hardware.

We can use our multiplexer function with simple types such as
\code{UInt}:

\shortlist{code/param_func_simple.txt}

\noindent The types of the two multiplexer paths need to be the same.
Following wrong usage of the multiplexer results in a runtime error:

\shortlist{code/param_func_wrong.txt}

\noindent We define our type as a \code{Bundle} with two fields:

\shortlist{code/param_func_type.txt}

\noindent We can define \code{Bundle} constants by first creating
a \code{Wire} and then setting the subfields.
Then we can use our parameterized multiplexer with this complex type.

\shortlist{code/param_func_complex.txt}

In our initial design of the function, we used \code{WireInit}
to create a wire with the type \code{T} with a default value.
If we need to create a wire just of the Chisel type without using a default
value, we can use \code{fPath.cloneType} to get the Chisel type.
Following function shows the alternative way to code the multiplexer.

\shortlist{code/param_func_alt.txt}

\subsection{Modules with Type Parameters}

We can also parameterize modules with Chisel types.
Let us assume we want to design a network-on-chip to move data between
different processing cores. However, we do not want to hardcode the
data format in the router interface; we want to \emph{parametrize} it.
Similar to the type parameter for a function, we add a type parameter \code{T}
to the Module constructor. Furthermore, we need to have one constructor
parameter of that type. Additionally, in this example, we also make the number
of router ports configurable.

\shortlist{code/param_mod.txt}

\noindent To use our router, we first need to define the data type we want to route, e.g.,
as a Chisel \code{Bundle}:

\shortlist{code/param_mod_type.txt}

\noindent We create a router by passing an instance of the user-defined Bundle and
the number of ports to the constructor of the router:

\shortlist{code/param_mod_use.txt}

\subsection{Parametrize Bundles}

In the router example, we used two different vectors of fields for the input
of the router: one for the address and one for the data, which was parameterized.
A more elegant solution would be to have a \code{Bundle} that itself
is parametrized. Something like:

\shortlist{code/param_bundle_issue.txt}

The \code{Bundle} has a parameter of type \code{T}, which is a subtype
of Chisel's \code{Data} type.
Within the bundle, we define a field \code{data} by invoking \code{cloneType}
on the parameter.
However, when we use a constructor parameter, this parameter becomes a
public field of the class. When Chisel needs to clone the type of the \code{Bundle},
e.g., when it is used in a \code{Vec}, this public field is in the way.
A solution (workaround) to this issue is to make the parameter field private:

\shortlist{code/param_bundle.txt}

\noindent With that new \code{Bundle}, we can define our router ports

\shortlist{code/param_mod2.txt}

\noindent and instantiate that router with a \code{Port} that takes
a \code{Payload} as a parameter:

\shortlist{code/param_mod_use2.txt}


\section{Generate Combinational Logic}

In Chisel, we can easily generate logic by creating a logic table with
a Chisel \code{Vec} from a Scala \code{Array}.
We might have data in a file, that we can read in during hardware generation
time for the logic table.
Listing~\ref{lst:file:reader} shows how to use the Scala \code{Source}
class form the Scala standard library to read the file ``data.txt'', which
contains integer constants in a textual representation.

A few words on the maybe a bit intimidating expression:
\begin{chisel}
  val table = VecInit(array.map(_.U(8.W)))
\end{chisel}

\noindent A Scala \code{Array} can be implicitly converted to a sequence (\code{Seq}),
which supports the mapping function \code{map}.
\code{map} invokes a function on each element of the sequence and returns
a sequence of the return value of the function. Our function \code{\_.U(8.W)} represents
each \code{Int} value from the Scala array as a \code{\_} and performs the conversion
from a Scala \code{Int} value to a Chisel \code{UInt} literal, with a size of 8-bits.
The Chisel object \code{VecInit} creates a Chisel \code{Vec} from a sequence \code{Seq}
of Chisel types.


\longlist{code/file_reader.txt}{Reading a text file to generate a logic table.}{lst:file:reader}

We can use the full power of Scala to generate our logic (tables).
E.g., generate a table of fixpoint constants to represent a trigonometric function,
compute constants for digital filters, or writing a small assembler in Scala
to generate code for a microprocessor written in Chisel. All those functions
are in the same code base (same language) and can be executed during
hardware generation.

A classic example is the conversion of a binary number
into a \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal}{binary-coded decimal}
(BCD) representation. BCD is used to represent a number in a decimal
format using 4 bits fo each decimal digit. For example, decimal \code{13} is in binary
\code{1101} and BCD encoded as 1 and 3 in binary: \code{00010011}.
BCD allows displaying numbers in decimal, a more user-friendly number
representation than hexadecimal.

We can write a Java program that computes the table to convert binary to BCD.
That Java program prints out VHDL code that can be included in a project.
The Java program is about 100 lines of code; most of the code generating
VHDL strings. The key part of the conversion is just two lines.

With Chisel, we can compute this table directly as part of the hardware generation.
Listing~\ref{lst:bcd} shows the table generation for the binary to BCD conversion.

\longlist{code/bcd_table.txt}{Binary to binary-coded decimal conversion.}{lst:bcd}

\section{Use Inheritance}
\label{sec:inheritance}

Chisel is an object-oriented language. A hardware component, the Chisel \code{Module}
is a Scala class. Therefore, we can use inheritance to factor a common behavior
out into a parent class. We explore how to use inheritance with an example.

In Section~\ref{sec:counter} we have explored different forms of counters,
which may be used for a low-frequency tick generation. Let us assume we want to
explore those different versions, e.g., to compare their resource requirement.
We start with an abstract class to define the ticking interface:

\shortlist{code/ticker.txt}

\noindent Listing~\ref{lst:ticker:up} shows a first implementation of that abstract class
with a counter, counting up, for the tick generation.

\longlist{code/up_ticker.txt}{Tick generation with a counter.}{lst:ticker:up}

We can test all different versions of our \emph{ticker} logic with a single test bench.
We \emph{just} need to define the test bench to accept subtypes of \code{Ticker}.
Listing~\ref{lst:ticker:test} shows the Chisel code for the tester.
The \code{TickerTester} has several parameters: (1) the type parameter
\code{[T <: Ticker]} to accept a \code{Ticker} or any class that inherits from \code{Ticker},
(2) the design under test, being of type \code{T} or a subtype thereof,
and (3) the number of clock cycles we expect for each tick.
The tester waits for the first occurrence of a tick (the start might be different for
different implementations) and then checks that \code{tick} repeats every $n$ clock cycles.

\longlist{code/ticker_tester.txt}{A tester for different versions of the ticker.}{lst:ticker:test}

With a first, easy implementation of the ticker, we can test the tester
itself, probably with some \code{println} debugging. When we are confident that
the simple ticker and the tester are correct, we can proceed and explore
two more versions of the ticker. Listing~\ref{lst:ticker:down} shows the tick
generation with a counter counting down to 0.
Listing~\ref{lst:ticker:nerd} shows the nerd version of counting down to -1 to use
less hardware by avoiding the comparator.

\longlist{code/down_ticker.txt}{Tick generation with a down counter.}{lst:ticker:down}

\longlist{code/nerd_ticker.txt}{Tick generation by counting down to -1.}{lst:ticker:nerd}

We can test all three versions of the ticker by using ScalaTest specifications,
creating instances of the different versions of the ticker and passing them
to the generic test bench. Listing~\ref{lst:ticker:spec} shows the specification.
We run only the ticker tests with:
\begin{chisel}
sbt "testOnly TickerSpec"
\end{chisel}

\longlist{code/ticker_spec.txt}{ScalaTest specifications for the ticker tests.}{lst:ticker:spec}




\chapter{Example Designs}

In this section, we explore some small size digital designs, such as
a FIFO buffer, which are used as building blocks for a larger design.
As another example, we design a serial interface (also called UART),
which itself may use the FIFO buffer.

在这个部分，我们探索一些中等大小的设计，例如FIFO缓冲，这个是用于大型设计中的部分。
作为一个例子，我们会设计一个串行接口（也称UART），它本身会使用FIFO缓冲器。

\section{FIFO Buffer}
\label{sec:fifo}

We can decouple a write (sender) and a reader (receiver) by a buffer
between the writer and reader.
A common buffer is a first-in, first-out
(\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_%28computing_and_electronics%29}{FIFO})
buffer. Figure~\ref{fig:fifo} shows a writer, the FIFO, and a reader.
Data is put into the FIFO by the writer on \code{din} with an active
\code{write} signal. Data is read from the the FIFO by the reader on
\code{dout} with an active \code{read} signal.

为了分离一个写入（发送者）和一个读取（接收者），在写和读取之间插入一些形式的缓冲。
一个常见的缓冲是一个先进先出（FIFO）缓冲器。
图7.1表明了一个写入，一个FIFO，和一个读取。数据通过din写入，和一个激活write的信号。
信号从FIFO读取通过读取dout，和一个激活read的信号。

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/fifo}
  \caption{A writer, a FIFO buffer, and a reader.}
  \label{fig:fifo}
\end{figure}

A FIFO is initially empty, singled by the \code{empty} signal. Reading
from an empty FIFO is usually undefined. When data is written and never
read a FIFO will become \code{full}. Writing to a full FIFO is usually ignored
and the data lost. In other words, the signals \code{empty} and \code{full}
serve as handshake signals 

FIFO初始是空的，通过empty信号表明空着。
从一个空的FIFO读取一般是没有被定义的。
当数据写入，并从来没有从FIFO读取，会变得full。
写入一个full的FIFO经常被忽略，数据随之丢失。
换句话说，empty和full充当握手信号。

Several different implementations of a FIFO are possible: E.g., using on-chip
memory and read and write pointers or simply a chain of registers with a
tiny state machine. For small buffers (up to tens of elements) a FIFO organized
with individual registers connected into a chain of buffers is a simple
implementation with a low resource requirement.
The code of the bubble FIFO is available in the
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples}{chisel-examples}
repository.\footnote{For completeness, the Chisel book repository contains
a copy of the FIFO code as well.}

可能有一些不同形式对FIFO的补充：
例如，使用片上存储，读取和写入指针或只是一连串的寄存器伴随小的状态寄存器。
对于小的缓冲器（最多十多种元素）， FIFO通过一些小的寄存器连接到一串缓冲是一个简单高效的写法。

We start by defining the IO signals for the writer and the reader side.
The size of the data is configurable with \code{size}.
The write data are \code{din} and a write is signaled by \code{write}.
The signal \code{full} performs the
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control_(data)}{flow control}
at the writer side.

\shortlist{code/bubble_fifo_writer_io.txt}

The reader side provides data with \code{dout} and the read is initiated
with \code{read}. The \code{empty} signal is responsible for the flow control
at the reader side.

\shortlist{code/bubble_fifo_reader_io.txt}

Listing~\ref{lst:fifo:stage} shows a single buffer. The buffer has a enqueueing port
\code{enq} of type \code{WriterIO} and a dequeueing port \code{deq} of type
\code{ReaderIO}. The state elements of the buffer is one register that holds the
data (\code{dataReg} and one state register for the simple FSM (\code{stateReg}).
The FSM has only two states: either the buffer is \code{empty} or \code{full}.
If the buffer is \code{empty}, a write will register the input data and change
to the \code{full} state.
If the buffer is \code{full}, a read will consume the data and change to the
\code{empty} state.
The IO ports \code{full} and \code{empty} represent the buffer state for
the writer and the reader.

\longlist{code/bubble_fifo_register.txt}{A single stage of the bubble FIFO.}{lst:fifo:stage}

Listing~\ref{lst:fifo} shows the complete FIFO. The complete FIFO has
the same IO interface as the individual FIFO buffers.
\code{BubbleFifo} has as parameters the \code{size} of the data
word and \code{depth} for the number of buffer stages.
We can build an \code{depth} stages bubble FIFO out of \code{depth}
\code{FifoRegister}s. We crate the stages by filling them into a Scala \code{Array}.
The Scala array has no hardware meaning, it \emph{just} provides us with
a container to have references to the created buffers.
In a Scala \code{for} loop we connect the individual buffers.
The first buffers enqueueing side is connected to the enqueueing IO of
the complete FIFO and the last buffer's dequeueing side to the
dequeueing side of the complete FIFO.

\longlist{code/bubble_fifo.txt}{A FIFO is composed of an array of FIFO bubble stages.}{lst:fifo}

The presented idea of connecting individual buffers to implement a FIFO
queue is called a bubble FIFO, as the data bubbles through the queue.
This is simple, and a good solution when the data rate is considerable slower
than the clock rate, e.g., as a decouple buffer for a serial port, which is presented
in the next section.

However, when the data rate approaches the clock frequency, the bubble FIFO
has two limitations: (1) As each buffer's state has to toggle between \emph{empty} and
\emph{full}, which means the maximum throughput of the FIFO is 2 clock cycles
per word. (2) The data needs to bubble through the complete FIFO, therefore,
the latency from the input to the output is at least the number of buffers.
I will present other possible implementations of FIFOs in Section~\ref{sec:more:fifo}.

\section{A Serial Port}

A serial port (also called
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter}{UART}
or \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232}{RS-232}) is one of the easiest options
to communicate between your laptop and an FPGA board.
As the name implies, data is transmitted serially. An 8-bit byte is transmitted as follows:
one start bit (0), the 8-bit data, least significant bit first, and then one or two stop
bits (1). When no data is transmitted, the output is 1.
Figure~\ref{fig:uart:wave} shows the timing diagram of one byte transmitted.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/uart_wave}
  \caption{One byte transmitted by a UART.}
  \label{fig:uart:wave}
\end{figure}

We design our UART in a modular way with minimal functionality
per module. We present a transmitter (TX), a receiver (RX),
a buffer, and then usage of those base components.

First, we need an interface, a port definition.
For the UART design, we use a ready/valid handshake interface,
with the direction as seen from the transmitter.
\shortlist{code/uart_channel.txt}
The convention of a ready/valid interface is that the data is transferred
when both \code{ready} and \code{valid} are asserted.

\longlist{code/uart_tx.txt}{A transmitter for a serial port.}{lst:uart:tx}

Listing~\ref{lst:uart:tx} shows a bare-bone serial transmitter (\code{Tx}).
The IO ports are the \code{txd} port, where the serial data is sent and
a \code{Channel} where the transmitter can receive the characters to serialize
and send.
To generate the correct timing, we compute a constant for by computing
the time in clock cycles for one serial bit.

We use three registers:
(1) register to shift the data (serialize them) (\code{shiftReg}),
(2) a counter to generate the correct baud rate (\code{cntReg}), and
(3) a counter for the number of bits that still need to be shifted out.
No additional state register of FSM is needed, all state is encoded in
those three registers.

Counter \code{cntReg} is continuously running (counting down to 0
and reset to the start value when 0). All action is only done when
\code{cntReg} is 0. As we build a minimal transmitter, we have only
the shift register to store the data. Therefore, the channel is only ready
when \code{cntReg} is 0 and no bits are left to shift out.

The IO port \code{txd} is directly connected to the least significant bit
of the shift register.

When there are more bits to shift out (\code{bitsReg =/= 0.U}),
we shift the bits to the right and fill with 1 from the top (the idle level
of a transmitter).
If no more bits need to be shifted out, we check if the channel contains
data (signaled with the \code{valid} port). If so, the bit string to
be shifted out is constructed with one start bit (0), the 8-bit data, and
two stop bits (1). Therefore, the bit count is set to 11.

This very minimal transmitter has no additional buffer and can
accept a new character only when the shift register is empty
and at the clock cycle when \code{cntReg} is 0.
Accepting new data only when \code{cntReg} is 0 also means
that the ready flag is also de-asserted when there would be
space in the shift register. However, we do not want to add this
``complexity'' to the transmitter but delegate it to a buffer.

\longlist{code/uart_buffer.txt}{A single-byte buffer with a ready/valid interface.}{lst:uart:buffer}
Listing~\ref{lst:uart:buffer} shows a single byte buffer, similar to
the FIFO register for the bubble FIFO. The input port is a \code{Channel}
interface, and the output is the \code{Channel} interface with
flipped directions. The buffer contains the minimal state machine
to indicate \code{empty} or \code{full}. The buffer driven handshake
signals (\code{in.ready} and \code{out.valid} depend on the state
register.

When the state is \code{empty}, and data on the input is \code{valid},
we register the data and switch to state \code{full}.
When the state is \code{full}, and the downstream receiver is
\code{ready}, the downstream data transfer happens, and we switch
back to state \code{empty}.

\longlist{code/uart_buffered_tx.txt}{A transmitter with an additional buffer.}{lst:uart:buffered:tx}
With that buffer we can extend our bare-bone transmitter.
Listing~\ref{lst:uart:buffered:tx} shows the combination of the transmitter \code{Tx}
with a single-buffer in front. This buffer now relaxes the issue that \code{Tx}
was \code{ready} only for single clock cycles. We delegated the solution of
this issue to the buffer module.
An extension of the single word buffer to a real FIFO can easily be done
and needs no change in the transmitter or the single byte buffer.

\longlist{code/uart_rx.txt}{A receiver for a serial port.}{lst:uart:rx}
Listing~\ref{lst:uart:rx} shows the code for the receiver (\code{Rx}).
A receiver is a little bit tricky, as it needs to reconstruct the timing of
the serial data. The receiver waits for the falling edge of the start bit.
From that event, the receiver waits 1.5 bit times to position itself into the middle
of bit 0. Then it shifts in the bits every bit time. You can observe these
two waiting times as \code{START\_CNT} and \code{BIT\_CNT}.
For both times, the same counter (\code{cntReg}) is used.
After 8 bits are shifted in, \code{valReg} signals an available byte

\longlist{code/uart_sender.txt}{Sending ``Hello World!" via the serial port.}{lst:uart:sender}
Listing~\ref{lst:uart:sender} shows the usage of the serial port transmitter
by sending a friendly message out. We define the message in a Scala
string (\code{msg}) and converting it to a Chisel \code{Vec} of \code{UInt}.
A Scala string is a sequence that supports the \code{map} method.
The \code{map} method takes as argument a function literal, applies this function to
each element, and builds a sequence of the functions return values.
If the function literal shall have only one argument, as it is in this case, the
argument can be represented by \code{\_}. Our function literal calls
the Chisel method \code{.U} to convert the Scala \code{Char} to a Chisel
\code{UInt}. The sequence is then passed to \code{VecInint} to construct
a Chisel \code{Vec}. We index into the vector \code{text} with the counter
\code{cntReg} to provide the individual characters to the buffered transmitter.
With each \code{ready} signal we increase the counter until the full string
is sent out. The sender keeps \code{valid} asserted until the last character
has been sent out.

\longlist{code/uart_echo.txt}{Echoing data on the serial port.}{lst:uart:echo}
Listing~\ref{lst:uart:echo} shows the usage of the receiver and the transmitter
by connecting them together. This connection generates an \code{Echo} circuit where each
received character is sent back (echoed).

\section{FIFO Design Variations}
\label{sec:more:fifo}.

In this section we will implement different variations of a FIFO queue.
To make these implementations interchangeable we will use inheritance,
as introduced in Section~\ref{sec:inheritance}. We define an \code{abstract}
FIFO class:

\shortlist{code/fifo_abstract.txt}

\noindent Note that we use a Chisel type as parameter to be able to buffer
any Chisel data type.
In Section~\ref{sec:fifo} we defined our own types for the interface with common
names for signals, such as \code{write}, \code{full}, \code{din}, \code{read},
\code{empty}, and \code{dout}. The input and the output of such a buffer consists
of data and two signals for handshaking (e.g., we \code{write} into the FIFO when
it is not \code{full}.
However, we can generalize this handshaking to the so called ready-valid interface.
E.g, we can enqueue an element (write into the FIFO) when the FIFO is \code{ready}.
We signal this at the writer side with \code{valid}.
As this ready-valid interface is so common, Chisel provides a definition
of this interface in \code{DecoupledIO} as follows:\footnote{This is a simplification,
as \codefoot{DecoupledIO} actually extends an abstract class.}

\shortlist{code/fifo_decoupled.txt}

\noindent The \code{DecoupledIO} interface is defined from the writer's (producer's) view point.
Therefore, enqueue port of the FIFO needs to flip the signal directions.

\section{Exercises}

This exercise section is a little bit longer as it contains two exercises:
(1) exploring the bubble FIFO and implement a different FIFO design;
and (2) exploring the UART and extending it.
Source code for both exercises is included in the
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples}{chisel-examples} repository.

\subsection{Explore FIFO Variations}

The FIFO source also includes a tester that provokes different read and write behavior and generates a waveform in the 
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump}{value change dump (VCD)} format.
The VCD file can be viewed with a waveform viewer, such as
\myref{http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/}{GTKWave}.
Explore the
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/blob/master/src/test/scala/simple/FifoTester.scala}{FifoTester} in the repository.
The repository contains a \code{Makefile} to run the examples, for the FIFO example
just type:
\begin{verbatim}
$ make fifo
\end{verbatim}
This make command will compile the FIFO, run the test, and starts GTKWave for waveform
viewing. Explore the tester and the generated waveform.

In the first cycles, the tester writes a single word. We can observe in
the waveform how that word bubbles through the FIFO, therefore the
name \emph{bubble FIFO}. This bubbling also means that the
latency of a data word through the FIFO is equal to the depth of the FIFO.

在第一个周期中，测试器会写一个单词。我们可以观察到
波形该字如何通过FIFO冒泡，因此
名称\emph{bubble FIFO}。这种冒泡也意味着
数据字通过FIFO的等待时间等于FIFO的深度。

The next test fills the FIFO until it is full. A single read follows.
Notice how the empty word bubbles from the reader side of the FIFO
to the writer side. When a bubble FIFO is full, it takes
a latency of the buffer depth for a read to affect the writer side. 

The end of the test contains a loop that tries to write and read at maximum speed.
We can see the bubble FIFO running at maximum bandwidth, which is two
clock cycles per word. A buffer stage has always to toggle between empty
and full for a single word transfer.

A bubble FIFO is simple and for small buffers has a low resource requirement.
The main drawbacks of an $n$ stage bubble FIFO are: (1) maximum throughput is
one word every two clock cycles, (2) a data word has to travel $n$ clock cycles
from the writer end to the reader end, and (3) a full FIFO needs $n$ clock cycles
for the restart.

These drawbacks can be solved by a FIFO implementation with a
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer}{circular buffer}.
The circular buffer can be implemented with a memory and
read and write pointers.
Implement a FIFO as a circular buffer with four elements, using the same
interface, and explore the different behavior with the tester.
For an initial implementation of the circular buffer use, as a shortcut,
a vector of registers (\code{Reg(Vec(4, UInt(size.W)))}).

\subsection{The UART}

For the UART example, you need an FPGA board with a serial port and
a serial port for your laptop (usually with a USB connection).
Connect the serial cable between the FPGA board and the serial port on
your laptop. Start a terminal program, e.g., Hyperterm on Windows
or \code{gtkterm} on Linux:
\begin{verbatim}
$ gtkterm &
\end{verbatim}
Configure your port to use the correct device, with a USB UART this
is often something like \code{/dev/ttyUSB0}. Set the baud rate to 115200
and no parity or flow control (handshake).
With the following command you can create the Verilog code for the UART:
\begin{verbatim}
$ make uart
\end{verbatim}
Then use your synthesize tool to synthesize the design.
The repository contains a Quartus project for the DE2-115 FPGA board.
With Quartus use the play button to synthesize the design and then configure
the FPGA.
After configuration, you should see a greeting message in the terminal.

Extend the blinking LED example with a UART and write 0 and 1 to the serial
line when the LED is off and on. Use the \code{BufferedTx}, as in the \code{Sender}
example.

With the slow output of characters (two per second), you can write the data
to the UART transmit register and can ignore the read/valid handshake.
Extend the example by writing repeated numbers 0-9 as fast as the baud rate allows.
In this case, you have to extend your state machine to poll the UART status
to check if the transmit buffer is free.

The example code contains only a single buffer for the \code{Tx}. Feel free to
add the FIFO that you have implemented to add buffering to the transmitter
and receiver. 

\chapter{Design of a Processor}

As one of the last chapters in this book, we present a medium size project:
the design, simulation, and testing of a microprocessor.
To keep this project manageable, we design a simple accumulator machine.
The processor is called \myref{https://leros-dev.github.io/}{Leros}~\cite{leros:arcs2019}
and is available in open source at \url{https://github.com/leros-dev/leros}.

作为本书的一个最后一章，我们讲述了一个中等大小的项目：设计，仿真和测试一个微处理器。
为了使这个项目科管理，我们会设计一个简单的累加器机器。
这个处理器被称为Leros，在开源 https://github.com/leros-dev/leros 可以使用。

We would like to mention that this is an advanced example and some computer
architecture knowledge is needed to follow the presented code examples.

Leros is designed to be simple, but still a good target for a C compiler.
The description of the instructions fits on one page, see Table~\ref{tab:leros:isa}.
In that table \code{A} represents the accumulator, \code{PC} is the program counter,
\code{i} is an immediate value (0 to 255), \code{Rn} a register
\code{n} (0 to 255), \code{o} a branch offset relative to the \code{PC},
and \code{AR} an address register for memory access.

Leros被设计为一个简单的，但是仍配备一个C编译器。
该指令的描述占一页，见表格8.1。
在那个表格，A代表累加器，OC使程序技术其，i使一个立即数（0到255）， Rn是一个寄存器n（0到255），o是一个相对于PC的分支偏置，并且AR是一个地址寄存器用于存储器访问。

A central component of a processor is the
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit}{arithmetic logic unit}, or ALU for short.
Therefore, we start with the coding of the ALU and a test bench.
First, we define an \code{Enum} to represent the different operations of the ALU:

处理器的一个中心组成部分是逻辑运算单元，或者ALU。
于是，我们从ALU和testbench开始编写。
首先，我们定义一个Enum代表ALU的不同操作：

\shortlist{code/leros_types.txt}

\noindent An ALU usually has two operand inputs (call them \code{a} and \code{b}), an operation \code{op}
(or opcode) input to select the function and an output \code{y}.
Listing~\ref{lst:leros-alu} shows the ALU.

ALU一般有两个操作数输入（称为a和b），一个操作op（或是op码）作为输入用来选择函数，和一个输出y。
图8.1表明ALU。

\todo{draw a nice ALU, see Wikipedia}

We first define shorter names for the three inputs. The \code{switch} statement defines the
logic for the computation of \code{res}. Therefore, it gets a default assignment of 0.
The switch statement enumerates all operations and assigns the expression accordingly.
All operations map directly to a Chisel expression.

我们首先定义一个短的输入名字。res的逻辑通过switch声明得到。于是，它得到一个默认值为0.

In the end, we assign the result \code{res} to the ALU output \code{y}

\longlist{code/leros_alu.txt}{The Leros ALU.}{lst:leros-alu}

For the testing, we write the ALU function in plain Scala, as shown in Listing~\ref{lst:leros-alu-scala}.

\longlist{code/leros_alu_ref.txt}{The Leros ALU function written in Scala.}{lst:leros-alu-scala}

\noindent While this duplication of hardware written in Chisel by a Scala implementation does not
detect errors in the specification; it is at least some sanity check.
We use some corner case values as the test vector:

\shortlist{code/leros_alu_testvec.txt}

\noindent We test all functions with those values on both inputs:

\shortlist{code/leros_alu_test.txt}

\noindent Full, exhaustive testing for 32-bit arguments is not possible, which was the reason we
selected some corner cases as input values. Beside testing against corner cases, it is also useful
to test against random inputs:

\shortlist{code/leros_alu_rand.txt}

\noindent You can run the tests within the Leros project with

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt "test:runMain leros.AluTester"
\end{verbatim}

and shall produce a success message similar to:

\begin{verbatim}
[info] [0.001] SEED 1544507337402
test Alu Success: 70567 tests passed in 70572 cycles taking
3.845715 seconds
[info] [3.825] RAN 70567 CYCLES PASSED
\end{verbatim}

\section{Decoding Instructions}

From the ALU, we work backward and implement the instruction decoder.
However, first, we define the instruction encoding in its own Scala class and
a \emph{shared} package. We want to share the encoding constants between
the hardware implementation of Leros, an assembler for Leros, and an instruction
set simulator of Leros.

\shortlist{code/leros_constants.txt}

\todo{Update code when Leros is more complete, as stuff is missing.}

\noindent For the decode component, we define a \code{Bundle} for the output,
which is later fed partially into the ALU.

\shortlist{code/leros_decode_bundle.txt}

\noindent Decode takes as input an 8-bit opcode and delivers the decoded signals
as output. Those driving signals are assigned a default value with \code{WireInit}.

\shortlist{code/leros_decode_init.txt}

\noindent The decoding itself is just a large switch statement on the part of the
instruction that represents the opcode (in Leros for most instructions the upper
8 bits.)

\shortlist{code/leros_decode.txt}

\section{Assembling Instructions}

To write programs for Leros we need an assembler. However, for the very first
test, we can hard code a few instructions, and put them into a Scala array,
which we use to initialize the instruction memory.

要为Leros编写程序，我们需要一个汇编程序。但是，首先
测试，我们可以对一些指令进行硬编码，然后将它们放入Scala数组中，
我们用来初始化指令存储器。

\shortlist{code/leros_asm_hard.txt}

\noindent However, this is a very inefficient approach to test a processor.
Writing an assembler with an expressive language like Scala is not a big project.
Therefore, we write a simple assembler for Leros, which is possible within about
100 lines of code. We define a function \code{getProgram} that calls the assembler.
For branch destinations, we need a symbol table, which we collect in a \code{Map}.
A classic assembler runs in two passes: (1) collect the values for the symbol table
and (2) assemble the program with the symbols collected in the first pass.
Therefore, we call \code{assemble} twice with a parameter to indicate which pass it is.

\shortlist{code/leros_asm_call.txt}

The \code{assemble} function starts with reading in the source
file\footnote{This function does not actually read the source file, but for this
discussion we can consider it as the reading function.}
and defining two helper functions to parse the two possible operands: (1) an
integer constant (allowing decimal or hexadecimal notation) and (2) to read
a register number.

\shortlist{code/leros_asm_start.txt}

Listing~\ref{lst:leros-asm-match} shows the core of the assembler for Leros.
A Scala \code{match} expression covers the core of the assembly function.
\todo{Some more words on the code.}



\longlist{code/leros_asm_match.txt}{The main part of the Leros assembler.}{lst:leros-asm-match}

\section{Exercise}

This exercise assignment in one of the last Chapters is in a very free form. You are at the end
of your learning tour through Chisel and ready to tackle design problems that
you find interesting.

最后章节的练习作业是非常自由的。你在学习Chisel旅程的末尾，并且准备解决有趣的设计难题。

One option is to reread the chapter and read along with all the source code in the
\myref{https://github.com/leros-dev/leros}{Leros repository}, run the test cases,
fiddle with the code by breaking it and see that tests fail.

其中一个选择是再次读本章节，并且读Leros仓库的源代码，运行测试案例，破坏代码，观察测试失败。

Another option is to write your implementation of Leros.
The implementation in the repository is just one possible organization of a pipeline.
You could write a Chisel simulation version of Leros with just a single pipeline stage,
or go crazy and superpipeline Leros for the highest possible clocking frequency.

另一个选择是简单写一个你对Leros的个人补充。
这个仓库的版本只是一种流水线的可能形式。
你可以写一个Chisel仿真版本的Keros使用只是一个单流水线，或者走向疯狂，尝试深度流水线的Leros，以达到最高的时钟频率的可能性。


A third option is to design your processor from scratch. Maybe the demonstration of
how to build the Leros processor and the needed tools has convinced you that processor
design and implementation is no magic art, but the engineering that can be very joyful.

第三个选择是从零设计你的处理器。
可能这个关于如何搭建Leros处理器的演示和所需要的工具已经让你感到信服：
这个处理器设计和补充不再是魔法，而可以是好玩的工程。

\chapter{Contributing to Chisel}

Chisel is an open-source project under constant development and improvement.
Therefore, you can also contribute to the project. Here we describe how to
set up your environment for Chisel library development and how to contribute
to Chisel.

\section{Setup the Development Environment}

Chisel consists of several different repositories; all hosted at
the \myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject}{freechips organization at GitHub}.

Fork the repository, which you like to contribute, into your personal GitHub account.
You can fork the repository by pressing the \code{Fork} button in the GitHub web interface.
Then from that fork, clone your fork of the repository. In our example, we change
\code{chisel3}, and the clone command for my local fork is:

\begin{verbatim}
$ git clone git@github.com:schoeberl/chisel3.git
\end{verbatim}

To compile Chisel 3 and publish as a local library execute:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd chisel3
$ sbt compile
$ sbt publishLocal
\end{verbatim}

Watch out during the publish local command for the version string of the published
library, which contains the string \code{SNAPSHOT}.
If you use the tester and the published version is not compatible with the Chisel
SNAPSHOT, fork and clone the \myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-testers}{chisel-tester}
repo as well and publish it locally.

To test your changes in Chisel, you probably also want to set up a Chisel project,
e.g., by forking/cloning an \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-empty}{empty Chisel project},
renaming it, and removing the \code{.git} folder from it.

Change the \code{build.sbt} to reference the locally published version of Chisel.
Furthermore, at the time of this writing, the head of Chisel source uses Scala 2.12, but Scala
2.12 has troubles with
\myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-template/issues/35}{anonymous bundles}.
Therefore, you need to add the following Scala option: \code{"-Xsource:2.11"}.
The \code{build.sbt} should look similar to:

\begin{verbatim}
scalaVersion := "2.12.6"

scalacOptions := Seq("-Xsource:2.11")

resolvers ++= Seq(
  Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots"),
  Resolver.sonatypeRepo("releases")
)

libraryDependencies +=
  "edu.berkeley.cs" %% "chisel3" % "3.2-SNAPSHOT"
libraryDependencies +=
  "edu.berkeley.cs" %% "chisel-iotesters" % "1.3-SNAPSHOT"
\end{verbatim}

Compile your Chisel test application and take a close look if it picks up the local published
version of the Chisel library (there is also a SNAPSHOT version published, so if, e.g.,
the Scala version is different between your Chisel library and your application code,
it picks up the SNAPSHOT version from the server instead of your local published
library.)

See also \myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3\#for-chisel-developers}{some notes
at the Chisel repo}.

\section{Testing}

When you change the Chisel library, you should run the Chisel tests.
In an \code{sbt} based project, this is usually run with:

更改Chisel库时，应运行Chisel测试。
在基于\code{sbt的项目中，通常使用以下命令运行：

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt test
\end{verbatim}

Furthermore, if you add functionality to Chisel, you should also provide tests for the
new features.


此外，如果您向Chisel添加功能，还应该提供针对
新功能。

\section{Contribute with a Pull Request}

In the Chisel project, no developer commits directly to the main repository.
A contribution is organized via a
\myref{https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/}{pull request}
from a branch in a forked version of the library.
For further information, see the documentation at GitHub on
\myref{https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/}{collaboration with
pull requests}.
The Chisel group started to document
\myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-lang-governance/blob/master/reviewer_guidelines.md}{contribution
guidelines}.

\section{Exercise}

Invent a new operator for the \code{UInt} type, implement it in the Chisel library,
and write some usage/test code to explore the operator. It does not need to be
a useful operator; just anything will be good, e.g., a ? operator that delivers the lefthand side
if it is different from 0 otherwise the righthand side. Sounds like a multiplexer, right?
How many lines of code did you need to add?\footnote{A quick and dirty implementation
needs just two lines of Scala code.}

As simple as this was, please be not tempted to fork the Chisel project and
add your little extensions. Changes and extension shall be coordinated with the
main developers.
This exercise was just a simple exercise to get you started.


尽管简单，请不要试图分支Chisel项目，
并添加您的小扩展。变更和扩展应与
主要开发商。
这项练习只是使您入门的简单练习。

If you are getting bold, you could pick one of the
\myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/issues}{open issues} and try to solve it.
Then contribute with a pull request to Chisel.
However, probably first watch the style of development in Chisel by watching the GitHub
repositories.
See how changes and pull requests are handled in the Chisel open-source project.


\chapter{Summary}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This book presented an introduction to digital design using the
hardware construction language Chisel.
We have seen several simple to medium-sized digital circuits
described in Chisel.
Chisel is embedded in Scala and therefore inherits the powerful
abstraction of Scala.
As this book is intended as an introduction, we have restricted
our examples to simple uses of Scala.
A next logical step is to learn a few basics of Scala and apply them
to your Chisel project.

本书介绍了使用
硬件构造语言Chisel。
我们已经看到了几种简单到中型的数字电路
在Chisel中描述。
Chisel嵌入在Scala中，因此继承了强大的功能
Scala的抽象。
由于本书旨在作为介绍，因此我们限制了
我们的示例简单介绍了Scala的用法。
下一步的逻辑步骤是学习Scala的一些基础知识并将其应用
到您的Chisel项目中。

I would be happy to receive feedback on the book, as I will further
improve it and will publish new editions. You can contact me at
\url{mailto:masca@dtu.dk}, or with an issue request on the GitHub
repository. I am also happily accepting pull requests
for the book repository for any fixes and improvements.

\section*{Source Access}

This book is available in open source.
The repository also contains slides for a Chisel course and
all Chisel examples: \url{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-book}

A collection of medium-sized examples, which most are referenced
in the book, is also available in open source. This collection
also contains projects for various popular FPGA boards:

\chapter{Chisel Projects}

Chisel is not (yet) used in many projects. Therefore, open-source Chisel code
to learn the language and the coding style is rare. Here we list several projects
we are aware of that use Chisel and are in open source.

尚未在许多项目中使用Chisel。因此，开源的Chisel代码
学习语言和编码风格的情况很少。这里我们列出了几个项目
我们知道使用Chisel是开源的。

\begin{description}

\item[\myref{https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip}{Rocket Chip}]
is a \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V}{RISC-V}~\cite{risc-v}
processor-complex generator that comprises the Rocket
microarchitecture and TileLink interconnect generators.  Originally developed
at UC Berkeley as the first chip-scale Chisel project~\cite{rocket:techrep}, Rocket Chip is now
commercially supported by \myref{https://www.sifive.com/}{SiFive}.
%The codebase at SiFive serves as a major test bench for Chisel and new Chisel features
%need to pass the tests at SiFive.

\item[\myref{https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-sodor}{Sodor}] is a collection of RISC-V
implementations intended for educational use. It contains 1, 2, 3, and 5 stages pipeline
implementations. All processors use a simple scratchpad memory shared by instruction
fetch, data access, and program loading via a debug port. Sodor is mainly intended to
be used in simulation.

\item[\myref{https://github.com/t-crest/patmos}{Patmos}] is an implementation of a
processor optimized for real-time systems~\cite{patmos:rts2018}. The Patmos repository
includes several multicore communication architectures, such as a time-predictable memory
arbiter~\cite{t-crest:memnoc}, a network-on-chip~\cite{s4nocni:arcs2019}
a shared scratchpad memory with an ownership~\cite{t-crest:ownspm}.
At the time of this writing, Patmos is still described in Chisel 2.

\item[\myref{https://github.com/pretis/flexpret}{FlexPRET}] is an implementation of a
precision timed architecture~\cite{Zimmer:EECS-2015-181}. FlexPRET implements
the RISC-V instruction set and has been updated to Chisel 3.1.

\item[\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/lipsi}{Lipsi}] is a tiny processor intended
for utility functions on a system-on-chip~\cite{lipsi:arcs2018}. As the code base of
Lipsi is very small, it can serve as an easy starting point for processor design in Chisel.
Lipsi also showcases the productivity of Chisel/Scala. It took me 14 hours to describe the
hardware in Chisel and run it on an FPGA, write an assembler in Scala, write a
Lipsi instruction set simulator in Scala for co-simulation, and write a few test cases
in Lipsi assembler.

\item[\myref{http://www.opensocfabric.org/}{OpenSoC Fabric}] is an open-source NoC
generator written in Chisel~~\cite{OpenSoC:ispass2016}. It is intended to provide a
system-on-chip for large-scale design exploration. The NoC itself is a state-of-the-art design with wormhole routing, credits for flow control, and virtual channels.
OpenSoC Fabric is still using Chisel~2.

\item[\myref{https://github.com/bu-icsg/xfiles-dana}{DANA}] is a neural network accelerator
that integrates with the RISC-V Rocket processor using the Rocket Custom Coprocessor (RoCC) interface~\cite{RoCC:2015}.
DANA supports inference and learning.

\end{description}

If you know an open-source project that uses Chisel, please drop me a note
so I can include it in a future edition of the book.


如果您知道使用Chisel的开源项目，请给我留言
因此我可以将其包含在本书的未来版本中。

\chapter{Chisel 2}

This book covers version 3 of Chisel. Moreover, Chisel 3 is recommended for new designs.
However, there is still Chisel 2 code out in the wild, which has not yet been converted
to Chisel 3. There is documentation available on how to convert a Chisel 2 project to
Chisel 3:


本书涵盖了Chisel的第3版。此外，Chisel3建议用于新设计。
但是，仍然有大量的Chisel2代码，尚未转换
到Chisel3。有有关如何将Chisel2项目转换为Chisel2的文档。
Chisel3：

\begin{itemize}
\item \myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/wiki/Chisel3-vs-Chisel2}{Chisel2 vs. Chisel3} and
\item \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/blob/master/TowardsChisel3.md}{Towards Chisel 3}
\end{itemize}

However, you might get involved in a project that still uses Chisel 2,
e.g., the \myref{https://github.com/t-crest/patmos}{Patmos}~\cite{patmos:rts2018} processor.
Therefore, we provide here some information on Chisel 2 coding for those who
have started with Chisel 3.

First, all documentation on Chisel 2 has been removed from the web sites
belonging to Chisel. We have rescued those PDF documents and put them
on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel2-doc}.
You can use the Chisel 2 tutorial by switching to the Chisel 2 branch:

\begin{chisel}
$ git clone https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-tutorial.git
$ cd chisel-tutorial
$ git checkout chisel2
\end{chisel}

The main visible difference between Chisel 3 and 2 are the definitions of
constants, bundles for IO, wires, memories, and probably older forms of register
definitions.


凿子3和2之间的主要可见区别是
常量，用于IO的捆束，电线，存储器以及可能是较旧形式的寄存器
定义。

Chisel 2 constructs can be used, to some extent, in a Chisel 3 project by
using the compatibility layer using as package \code{Chisel} instead of \code{chisel3}.
However, using this compatibility layer should only be used in a transition phase.
Therefore, we do not cover it here.

Here are two examples of basic components, the same that have been presented
for Chisel 3. A module containing combinational logic:

\shortlist{chisel2/src/main/scala/Logic.scala}

Note that the \code{Bundle} for the IO definition is \emph{not} wrapped into
an \code{IO()} class.  Furthermore, the direction of the different IO ports is defined
as part of the type definition, in this example as \code{INPUT} and \code{OUTPUT}
as part of \code{UInt}. The width is given as the second parameter.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
The 8-bit register example in Chisel 2:

\shortlist{chisel2/src/main/scala/Register.scala}
\end{minipage}

Here you see a typical register definition with a reset value passed in as
a \code{UInt} to the named parameter \code{init}. This form is still valid in Chisel 3,
but the usage of \code{RegInit} and \code{RegNext} is recommended for new Chisel 3 designs.
Note also here the constant definition of an 8-bit wide 0 as \code{UInt(0, 8)}.

Chisel based testing C++ code and Verilog code are generated by calling \code{chiselMainTest}
and \code{chiselMain}. Both ``main'' functions take a \code{String} array for further parameters.

\shortlist{chisel2/src/main/scala/LogicTester.scala}

\shortlist{chisel2/src/main/scala/LogicHardware.scala}

A memory with sequential registered read and write ports is defined in Chisel 2 as:

\begin{chisel}
  val mem = Mem(UInt(width = 8), 256, seqRead = true)
  val rdData = mem(Reg(next = rdAddr))
  when(wrEna) {
    mem(wrAddr) := wrData
  }
\end{chisel}

\subsection*{Course Abstract}

Chisel is a hardware construction language implemented as a domain specific language in Scala. Therefore, the full power of a modern programming language is available to describe hardware and, more important, hardware generators. Chisel has been developed at UC Berkeley and successfully used for several tape outs of RISC-V. Here at DTU we used Chisel in the T-CREST project and in teaching advanced computer architecture.

In this course I will give an overview of Chisel to describe circuits at the RTL, how to use the Chisel tester functionality to test and simulate digital circuits, present how to synthesize circuits for an FPGA, and present advanced functionality of Chisel for the description of circuit generators. Besides lecturing we will have lab sessions to describe small circuits and evaluate them in an FPGA.

The aim of the course is to get a basic understanding of a modern hardware description language and be able to describe simple circuits in Chisel. This course shall give a basis to explore more advanced concepts of circuit generators written in Chisel/Scala.
